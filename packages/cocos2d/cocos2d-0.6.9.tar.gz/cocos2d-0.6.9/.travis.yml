# notice that pypy may or may not work for real: test in CI has small coverage, pyglet and cocos uses ctypes,
# cocos particles and audio SDL uses numpy (ctypes and numpy are problematic with pypy)
# py3 should be tested only on CPython versions actively supported, meaning receiving security updates, look
# at https://docs.python.org/devguide/#status-of-python-branches for status
