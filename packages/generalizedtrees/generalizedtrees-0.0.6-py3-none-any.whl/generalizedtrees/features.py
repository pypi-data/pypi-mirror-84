    Maps numpy/pandas dtypes to FeatureSpecs.

    'category' dtypes are discrete, and treated according to their 'ordered' attribute.

    Makes use of dtype.kind attribute (see numpy documentation)
    Currently, classifies datatypes as follows:
    Continuous (ordered and not discrete):
        f (floating point)
        m (timedelta)
        M (datetime)
    Ordinal (ordered and discrete)
        i (signed integer)
        u (unsigned integer)
        b (boolean)
    Neither ordered nor discrete:
        c (complex floating-point)
    Remaining types are discrete (and unordered):
        O (object)
        S (byte-)string
        U Unicode
        V void
