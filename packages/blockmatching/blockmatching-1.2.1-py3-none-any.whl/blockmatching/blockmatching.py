Block Matching Algorithm.
------------------------
According to [cuevs2013]_ in a block matching (BM) approach:

    '...image frames in a video sequence are divided into blocks. For each
    block in the current frame, the best matching block is identified inside a
    region of the previous frame, aiming to minimize the sum of absolute
    differences...'

From the work of  [perez2010]_:

    '...pixel-specific motion vectors are determined by calculating the RMSE of
     the difference between two consecutive Kt*grids surrounding the considered
     pixel when the second grid is advected in the direction of a motion vector.
     The selected motion vector corresponds to the lowest RMSE. This process is
     repeated for each image pixel, and each pixel is assigned an individual
     motion vector. Future images are obtained by displacing the current image
     pixels in the direction of their motion vector. Future images are
     subsequently smoothed by averaging each pixel with its 8 surrounding
     neighbors...'

For example, considering a image, in  :math:`t_0 + k dt`, with 9x9 pixels and a
block grid with 3x3 pixels. The image bellow  it is assumed that the central
pixel C is surrounding by pixels A.

::

    * * * * * * * * *
    * * * * * * * * *
    * * * * * * * * *
    * * * A A A * * *
    * * * A C A * * *
    * * * A A A * * *
    * * * * * * * * *
    * * * * * * * * *
    * * * * * * * * *


Now, for a image in time :math:`t_0 + (k+1)dt`, the value of block with the pixel C,
in the image in :math:`t_0 +kdt`, is compared with values of piexls in the 9x9 window
of the image in :math:`t_0+(k+1)dt`.

The most probable direction of the moviment of the pixel C, at
:math:`t_0 + (k+1)dt`, is given by the position of the corresponding block with
the lowest square mean error -SME (subtraction of the 3x3 subgrid)
(e.g. [khawase17]_).

In the following example, the 3x3 block was in the initial position i=4, j=4.
The new initial subblock with lowest  is in i=7, j=7.

Initial position of 3x3 block in :math:`t_0 + kdt`:

::

* * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * *
* * * A A A * * *
* * * A C A * * *
* * * A A A * * *
* * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * *

The new position of 3x3 block in :math:`t_0 + (i+1)dt`:

::

* * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * A A A
* * * * * * A C A
* * * * * * A A A

The size of search window depend of the expected velocity of the block. For
slow moviment, a window with size of 3  times can be considered.

:Example:

>>> import cv2
>>> from blockmatching import *
>>> cap = cv2.VideoCapture('./videos/car.mp4')
>>> started = False
>>> old_frame = None
>>> while cap.isOpened():
>>>    ret, frame = cap.read()
>>>    if ret == True:
>>>        frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
>>>        if started is False:
>>>            old_frame = frame
>>>            started = True
>>>        else:
>>>            XP, YP, XD, YD = block_matching(old_frame, frame,
>>>                                            width, height)
>>>            old_frame = frame
>>>    else:
>>>         break
>>>
>>> cap.release()
