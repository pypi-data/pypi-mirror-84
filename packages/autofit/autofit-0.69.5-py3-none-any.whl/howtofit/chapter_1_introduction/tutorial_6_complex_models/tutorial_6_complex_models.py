Tutorial 6: Complex Models
==========================

Up to now, we've fitted a very simple model, a 1D `Gaussian` with 3 free parameters. In this tutorial, we'll look at
how **PyAutoFit** allows us to compose and fit models of arbitrary complexity.

To begin, you should check out the module `tutorial_6_complex_models/model/profiles.py`. In previous tutorials this
module was called `gaussian.py` and contained only the `Gaussian` class. The module now includes a second profile,
_Exponential_, which like the `Gaussian` class is a model-component that can be fitted to data.

Up to now, our data has always been generated using a single `Gaussian` profile. Thus, we have only needed to fit
it with a single `Gaussian`. In this tutorial, our `Dataset` is now a superpositions of multiple profiles. The models
we compose and fit are therefore composed of multiple profiles, such that when we generate the model-data we
generate it as the sum of all individual profiles in our model.

Now we can create a model composed of multiple components, lets fit it to a `Dataset`. To do this, we updated this 
tutorial`s `phase` package, spefically its `Analysis` class such that it creates `model_data` as a super position of 
all the model`s individual `Profile`'s. For example, in the model above, the `model_data` is the sum of the 
`Gaussian``s  individual profile and `Exponential`'s individual profile.

Checkout `phase.py` and `analysis.py` now, for a description of how this has been implemented.

Quickly inspect the `Result`'s of the fit, which you may have noticed takes a bit longer to run than the fits performed
in previous tutorials. This is because the dimensionality of the model we are fitted increased from 3 to 6.

And with that, we are complete. In this tutorial, we learned how to compose complex models in **PyAutoFit** and adjust 
our `phase.py` and `analyis.py` modules to fit them. To end, you should think again in more detail about your model
fitting problem:

Are there many different model components you may wish to define and fit?

Is your data the super position of many different model components, like the profiles in this tutorial?

In this tutorial, all components of our model did the same thing, represent a 1D profile. In your model, you may
have model components that represent different parts of your model, which need to be combined in more complicated ways
in order to create your model-fit. In such circumstances, the `fit` method in your `Analysis` class may be 
significantly more complex than the example shown in this tutorial. Nevertheless, you now have all the tools you need 
to define, compose and fit very complex models, there isn't much left for you to learn on your journey through **PyAutoFit**!
