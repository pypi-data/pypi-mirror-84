    Operators should be aware that nova-api has a dependency on eventlet for
    executing parallel queries across multiple cells and is monkey-patched
    accordingly. When nova-api is running under uWSGI or mod_wsgi, the wsgi
    app will pause after idle time. While the wsgi app is paused, rabbitmq
    heartbeats will not be sent and log messages related to this can be seen
    in the nova-api logs when the wsgi app resumes when new requests arrive to
    the nova-api. These messages are not harmful. When the wsgi app resumes,
    oslo.messaging will reconnect to rabbitmq and requests will be served
    successfully.

    There is one caveat, which is that the wsgi app configuration must be left
    as the default ``threads=1`` or set explicitly to ``threads=1`` to ensure
    that reconnection will work properly. When threads > 1, it is not
    guaranteed that oslo.messaging will reconnect to rabbitmq when the wsgi app
    resumes after pausing during idle time. Threads are used internally by
    oslo.messaging for heartbeats and more, and it may fail in a variety of
    ways if run under eventlet with an app that violates eventlet's threading
    guarantees. When oslo.messaging does not reconnect to rabbitmq after a
    wsgi app pause, RPC requests will fail with a ``MessagingTimeout`` error.
    So, it is necessary to have the wsgi app configured with ``threads=1`` for
    reconnection to work properly.

    If running with ``threads=1`` is not an option in a particular environment,
    there are two other workarounds:

    * Use the eventlet wsgi server instead of uWSGI or mod_wsgi, or

    * Disable eventlet monkey-patching using the environment variable
      ``OS_NOVA_DISABLE_EVENTLET_PATCHING=yes``.

      Note that disabling eventlet monkey-patching will cause queries across
      multiple cells to be serialized instead of running in parallel and this
      may be undesirable in a large deployment with multiple cells, for
      performance reasons.
