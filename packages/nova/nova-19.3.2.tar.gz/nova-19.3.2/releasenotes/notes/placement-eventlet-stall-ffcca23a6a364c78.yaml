    In Stein the Placement service is available either as part of Nova, or
    independently packaged from its own project. This is to allow easier
    migration from one to another. See the `upgrade notes`_ for more
    information.

    When using the Placement packaged from Nova, some deployment strategies can
    lead to the service stalling with error messages similar to::

        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/eventlet/hubs/hub.py", line 460, in fire_timers
            timer()
          File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/eventlet/hubs/timer.py", line 59, in __call__
            cb(*args, **kw)
          File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/eventlet/semaphore.py", line 147, in _do_acquire
            waiter.switch()
        error: cannot switch to a different thread

    The reasons this is happening are discussed in bug 1829062_. There are
    three workarounds available:

    * In the environment of the web server running the placement service, set
      ``OS_NOVA_DISABLE_EVENTLET_PATCHING=yes`` so that eventlet does not
      conflict with thread handling in the web server.

    * Turn off threading in the web server. For example, if using ``mod_wsgi``
      or ``uwsgi``, set ``threads=1`` in their respective configurations.

    * Switch to using the extracted placement. It does not suffer from eventlet.
