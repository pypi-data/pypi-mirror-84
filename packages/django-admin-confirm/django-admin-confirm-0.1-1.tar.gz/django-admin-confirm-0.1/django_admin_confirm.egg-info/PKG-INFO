        ![Screenshot of Confirmation Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrangPham/django-admin-confirm/main/screenshot.png)
        
        It can be configured to add a confirmation page upon saving changes and/or additions on ModelAdmin.
        
        Typical Usage:
        
        ```py
            from admin_confirm import AdminConfirmMixin
        
            class MyModelAdmin(AdminConfirmMixin, ModelAdmin):
                confirm_change = True
                confirmation_fields = ['field1', 'field2']
        ```
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install django-admin-confirm by running:
        
            pip install django-admin-confirm
        
        Add to INSTALLED_APPS in your project settings before `django.contrib.admin`:
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'admin_confirm',
        
                'django.contrib.admin',
                ...
            ]
        
        Note that this project follows the template override rules of Django.
        To override a template, your app should be listed before `admin_confirm` in INSTALLED_APPS.
        
        ## Configuration Options
        
        - `confirm_change` _Optional[bool]_ - decides if changes should trigger confirmation
        - `confirm_add` _Optional[bool]_ - decides if additions should trigger confirmation
        - `confirmation_fields` _Optional[Array[string]]_ - sets which fields changes should trigger confirmation
        - `change_confirmation_template` _Optional[string]_ - path to custom html template to use
        
        Note that setting `confirmation_fields` without setting `confirm_change` or `confirm_add` would not trigger confirmation.
