        Return the Myers diff of two lists.
        
        The result is a list of (action, line) pairs,
        where ``action`` is one of ``KEEP``, ``INSERT``, ``REMOVE``, or ``OMIT``
        (which happen to be the characters k, i, r, and o).
        
        ARGUMENTS:
           ``a``, ``b``:
             The two files to compare
        
           ``context``:
             How many lines of context to keep between blocks of changes?
             ``None``, the default, means keep all unchanged lines.
             ``0`` means throw away all the unchanged lines.
        
           ``format``:
             If a dictionary, it is used to format
             each diff entry.  If true, the default dictionary above is
             used to format the diff entries.  Otherwise they are returned as-is.
