### GenericTask
More specific class which adds the possiblity to get the actual value and implements user handling.
The data is saved to a `JSON` file.
The callback method ( `callback(self, context: telegram.ext.CallbackContext)`) must be implemented.

### UrlTask
Extension of the `GenericTask` to simplify the usage for jobs calling a URL and returning the link/ response to the subscribers.
It retries every 2 seconds until it gets a response.

This class adds a `url` field where the information lies.

The `handle_response(self, response: Response)` must be implemented to extract the data from the request and return the message string.
