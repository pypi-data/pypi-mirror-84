        ## Classes
        There are several classes included in this Package.
        
        ### Task
        Base class for recurring tasks.
        
        #### Configuration
        * `job_name: str` Name of the job defined in this task
        * `disable_notifications: bool` Disable notifications, flag send to the telegram server
        * `generic: bool` Defines if the task looks the same for each user 
        * `first_time:time` First time to run the task, 0 is now takes a `datetime.time`
        * `repeat_time: timedelta` Defines the time between two executions of the job, takes `datetime.timedelta`
        * `filename: str` Filename under which data specific to this job should be saved
        
        ### GenericTask
        More specific class which adds the possiblity to get the actual value and implements user handling.
        The data is saved to a `JSON` file.
        The callback method ( `callback(self, context: telegram.ext.CallbackContext)`) must be implemented.
        
        ### UrlTask
        Extension of the `GenericTask` to simplify the usage for jobs calling a URL and returning the link/ response to the subscribers.
        It retries every 2 seconds until it gets a response.
        
        This class adds a `url` field where the information lies.
        
        The `handle_response(self, response: Response)` must be implemented to extract the data from the request and return the message string.
