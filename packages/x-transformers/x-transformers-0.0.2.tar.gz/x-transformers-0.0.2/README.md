## x-transformers (wip)

X stands for **ex**perimental

A simple full-attention transformer, but also complete with a set of promising experimental features from various papers.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install x-transformers
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from x_transformers import XTransformer

model = XTransformer(
    num_tokens = 256,
    dim = 512,
    depth = 6,
    heads = 8,
    max_seq_len = 1024
)

src = torch.randint(0, 256, (1, 1024))
src_mask = torch.ones_like(src).bool()
tgt = torch.randint(0, 256, (1, 1024))
tgt_mask = torch.ones_like(tgt).bool()

model(src, tgt, src_mask = src_mask, tgt_mask = tgt_mask) # (1, 1024, 512)
```
