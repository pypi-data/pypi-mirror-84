Composition Example
===============================================================================

 Demonstrate the use of Compostion of Atom objects.

1. If the class has not been declared, use a ForwardTyped
   - Note the use of lambda, because "Person" is not yet defined

2. A Typed object can be instantiated three ways:
   - Provide args, kwargs, or a factory in the definition
   - Provide a _default_* static constructor
   - Provide a pre-created object in the constructor

.. TIP:: To see this example in action, download it from
 :download:`composition <../../../examples/api/composition.py>`
 and run::

   $ python composition.py
