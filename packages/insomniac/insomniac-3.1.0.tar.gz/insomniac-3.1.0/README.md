### Why you should automate Instagram activity (liking, following, etc.)?
ðŸ’¸ If you want just to _increase_ your followers count or get more likes, there's a bunch of companies that will give you that immediately for a few $$$. But most likely your audience will be bots and mass-followers.

ðŸŒ± If you want to get engaged followers, that will be interested in your content and probably will pay you for your services, then _automation_ is the right way.

ðŸŽ¯ This Instagram bot provides you methods to **target** on the audience that is most likely interested **in you**. These methods are:
1. Interact with followers of **bloggers** with similar content
2. Interact with likers of **hashtags** that you use
3. **Filter** accounts to avoid bots and mass-followers

ðŸ“ˆ Using these methods altogether gives the best result.

### How to install
1. Run `python3 -m pip install insomniac` in Terminal / Command Prompt<br/><sub><sup>Provided **python** and **pip** are installed already. Learn <a href="https://github.com/alexal1/Insomniac/wiki/Install-Python">how to check it</a>.</sup></sub>
2. Save [start.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexal1/Insomniac/master/start.py) file which launches the script
2. Download and unzip [Android platform tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools), move them to a folder where you won't delete them accidentally, e.g.
```
mkdir -p ~/Library/Android/sdk
mv <path-to-downloads>/platform-tools/ ~/Library/Android/sdk
```
3. [Add platform-tools path to the PATH environment variable](https://github.com/alexal1/Insomniac/wiki/Adding-platform-tools-to-the-PATH-environment-variable). If you do it correctly, Terminal / Command Prompt command `adb devices` will print `List of devices attached`

### How to install on Raspberry Pi OS
1. Update apt-get: `sudo apt-get update`
2. Install ADB and Fastboot: `sudo apt-get install -y android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot`
3. Install insomniac: `python3 -m pip install insomniac`
4. Save [start.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexal1/Insomniac/master/start.py) file

### Get started
1. Connect Android device to your computer with a USB cable
2. Enable [Developer options](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable) on the device
>On Android 4.1 and lower, the Developer options screen is available by default. On Android 4.2 and higher, you must enable this screen. To enable developer options, tap the Build Number option 7 times. You can find this option in one of the following locations, depending on your Android version:
>
> Android 9 (API level 28) and higher: Settings > About Phone > Build Number
>
> Android 8.0.0 (API level 26) and Android 8.1.0 (API level 26): Settings > System > About Phone > Build Number
>
> Android 7.1 (API level 25) and lower: Settings > About Phone > Build Number
3. Switch on **USB debugging** (and also **Install apps via USB** and **Allow ADB debugging in charge only mode** if there are such options) on the Developer options screen.
4. Device will ask you to allow computer connection. Press "Connect"
5. Type `adb devices` in terminal. It will display attached devices. There should be exactly one device. Then run the script (it works on Python 3):
6. Open Terminal / Command Prompt in the folder with downloaded [start.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexal1/Insomniac/master/start.py) (or type `cd <path-to-start.py>`) and run
```
python3 start.py --interact @natgeo
```
Make sure that the screen is turned on and device is unblocked. You don't have to open Instagram app, script opens it and closes when it's finished. Just make sure that Instagram app is installed. If everything's fine, script will open `@natgeo`'s followers and like their posts.

### Usage example
Let's say you have a travel blog. Then you may want to use such setup:
```
python3 start.py --interact @natgeo amazingtrips beautifuldestinations --interactions-count 20-30 --likes-count 1-3 --follow-percentage 20 --repeat 120-180
```
The script will sequentially interact with 20-30 `@natgeo`'s followers, 20-30 `#amazingtrips` posts likers, and 20-30 `#beautifuldestinations` posts likers. During each interaction it will like 1-3 random posts and also follow 20% of interacted users. After finished it will close Instagram app and wait for 120-180 minutes. Then the script will repeat the same (and will repeat infinitely), but already interacted users will be ignored. The list of sources (`@natgeo`, `#amazingtrips` and `#beutifuldestinations`) will be shuffled each time.

All this randomness makes it very hard for Instagram to detect that you're using a bot. However, be careful with number of interactions, because even a human can be banned for violating limits.

### FAQ
- How to stop the script?<br/>_Ctrl+C (control+C for Mac)_

- Can I prevent my phone from falling asleep while the script is working?<br/>_Yes. Settings -> Developer Options -> Stay awake._

- What to do if I got soft ban (cannot like/follow/comment)?<br/>_Clear Instagram application data. You'll have to login again and then it will work as usual. But it's **highly recommended** to lower your interactions count for the future and take a pause with the script._

### Extra features
All core features in this project are free to use. But you may want to get more fine grained control over the bot via these features:
- **Filtering** - skip unwanted accounts by various parameters, [more here](#filtering)
- **Removing mass followers** - automate "cleaning" your account
- **Analytics tool** - build presentation that shows your growth, [more here](#analytics)
- **Scrapping (next release)** - will make interactions significantly safer and faster

Activate these features by supporting our small team on Patreon: [https://insomniac-bot.com/activate/](https://insomniac-bot.com/activate/).

### Source code
Since core features are free to use, their code is right here in the [src folder](https://github.com/alexal1/Insomniac/tree/master/src). You can help the community by making a pull request. It will be added to the packaged version after successful review. To work with sources, please
1. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/alexal1/Insomniac.git`
2. Go to Insomniac folder: `cd Insomniac`
3. Install required libraries: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Launch the script via `python3 -m src.insomniac`

Note that [src](https://github.com/alexal1/Insomniac/tree/master/src) code may differ from the packaged code. Generally, the packaged code is more stable.

_2020-10-31: Right now there's quite big difference, but we will synchronize packaged and opensource version ASAP._

### Filtering
You may want to ignore mass-followers (e.g. > 1000 followings) because they are most likely interested only in growing their audience. Or ignore too popular accounts (e.g. > 5000 followers) because they won't notice you. You can do this (and more) by using the filter:

| Parameter                 | Value         | Description                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `skip_business`           | `true/false`  | skip business accounts if true                                                                         |
| `skip_non_business`       | `true/false`  | skip non-business accounts if true                                                                     |
| `min_followers`           | 100           | skip accounts with less followers than given value                                                     |
| `max_followers`           | 5000          | skip accounts with more followers than given value                                                     |
| `min_followings`          | 10            | skip accounts with less followings than given value                                                    |
| `max_followings`          | 1000          | skip accounts with more followings than given value                                                    |
| `min_potency_ratio`       | 1             | skip accounts with ratio (followers/followings) less than given value (decimal values can be used too) |
| `follow_private_or_empty` | `true/false`  | private/empty accounts also have a chance to be followed if true                                       |

You can read detailed explanation and instructions how to use it [in the Patreon post](https://www.patreon.com/posts/43362005) **(you'll have to join $10 tier)**.

### Whitelist and Blacklist
**Whitelist** â€“ affects `--remove-mass-followers`, `--unfollow` and all other unfollow actions. Users from this list will _never_ be removed from your followers or unfollowed.

**Blacklist** - affects _all other actions_. Users from this list will be skipped immediately: no interactions and no following.

Go to Insomniac folder and create a folder named as your Instagram nickname (or open an existing one, as Insomniac creates such folder when launched). Create there a file `whitelist.txt` or `blacklist.txt` (or both of them). Write usernames in these files, one username per line, no `@`'s, no commas. Don't forget to save. That's it! 

### Analytics
There also is an analytics tool for this bot. It is a script that builds a report in PDF format. The report contains account's followers growth graphs for different periods. Liking, following and unfollowing actions' amounts are on the same axis to determine bot effectiveness. The report also contains stats of sessions length for different configurations that you've used. All data is taken from `sessions.json` file that's generated during bot's execution.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexal1/Insomniac/master/res/analytics_sample.png">

To get access to the analytics tool you have to [join Patreon $10 tier](https://www.patreon.com/insomniac_bot).

### Features in progress
- [x] Follow given percentage of interacted users by `--follow-percentageÂ 50`
- [x] Unfollow given number of users (only those who were followed by the script) by `--unfollowÂ 100`
- [x] Unfollow given number of non-followers (only those who were followed by the script) by `--unfollow-non-followersÂ 100`
- [x] Support intervals for likes and interactions count like `--likes-count 2-3`
- [x] Interaction by hashtags
- [ ] Add random actions to behave more like a human (watch your own feed, stories, etc.)
- [ ] Commenting during interaction

### Why Insomniac?
There already are Instagram automation tools that work either on Instagram web version or via Instagram private API. Unfortunately, both ways have become dangerous to use. Instagram bots detection system is very suspicious to browser actions now. And as for private API â€“ you will be blocked forever if Instagram detects that you're using it.

That's why need arised in a solution for mobile devices. Instagram can't distinguish bot from a human when it comes to your phone. However, even a human can reach limits when using the app, so don't fail to be careful. Always set `--total-likes-limit` to 300 or less. Also it's better to use `--repeat` to act periodically for 2-3 hours, because Instagram keeps track of how long the app works.

### Community
