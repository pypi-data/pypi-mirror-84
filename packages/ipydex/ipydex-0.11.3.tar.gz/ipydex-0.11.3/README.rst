"IPython based debugging and exploring"

The module contains two main parts:

displaytools
------------
* a jupyter-notebook-extension (``%loadext ipydex.displaytools``)

* introduces magic comments (like ``##:``, ``##:T``, ``##:S``) which cause
  that either the return value or the right hand side of an assignment of a line
  is displayed (``T`` means additional transposition and ``S`` means only ``.shape`` attribute is displayed)

* display intermediate results  (â†’ more readable notebooks),
  without introducing additional ``print`` or ``display`` statements

* Example invocation: ``x = np.random.rand() ##:``

  * inserts the line ``display("x := {}".format(x))`` to the source code of the cell (before its execution)

* see `documentation-notebook <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cknoll/ipydex/blob/master/examples/displaytools-example.ipynb>`_


**Security advice**: Because the extension manipulates the source code before its execution, it might cause unwanted and strange behavior. Thus, this program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, *but without any warranty*.

Useful functions
----------------

The following functions are meant to be used in ordinary python-scripts:

* ``IPS()``

  - start an embedded IPython shell in the calling scope

  - useful to explore what objects are available and what are their abilities

  - some additional features compared to ``IPython.embed()``

* ``ST()``

  - start the IPython debugger

* ``activate_ips_on_exception()``

  - activate an embedded IPython shell in the scope where an exception occurred

  - useful to investigate what happened

* ``dirsearch(name, obj)``

  - search the keys of a dict or the attributes of an object

  - useful to explore semi known modules, classes and data-structures


Notes
=====
This package is not yet well tested and would deserve some refactoring.
Nevertheless it might be useful.
