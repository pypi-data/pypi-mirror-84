You can install Inary on your system with commands.

# ./setup.py build
# ./setup.py install
su -c "ln -s /usr/local/bin/inary-cli /usr/bin/inary"

If you are on a Solus or PisiLinux system, you should delete /usr/lib/pardus/pisi
when you are installing the SVN version

If you are upgrading from an old INARY release you may have to
run the following command as root:

# inary rebuild-db

Add Sulin repository
su -c "inary ar sulin https://gitlab.com/sulinos/repositories/SulinRepository/-/raw/master/inary-index.xml"
