Basics of INARY
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In these pages, I will explain how you can continue your life using inary.

There will be many detailed uses and hints from installing, removing packages and repos, to searching for \
the package or file you are looking for, or even commands that will help you extract the tree of dependency \
(except for packers, I don't know why).

.. note:: the commands here are simply transferred to avoid the eye of the end user. If you want to dig a little more and see the detailed information, you can try to review the "--debug" and "--verbose" parameters. Commands given with these parameters will come with many different control outputs.
