# Release Process

* Make sure that the code is in a good shape, all tests are passed etc.
* Switch to `master` branch (`git checkout master`).
* Open `VERSION.txt`, increment the file content, e.g. `20.6.22`.

* Run `towncrier` to update `CHANGELOG.md`.
* Open `CHANGELOG.md`, make sure that the generated file content looks good. Fix it if needed.
* Regenerate site docs.
  * You need a clone of https://github.com/neuromation/platform-web project sibling to this repo.
  * Run `./build-tools/site-help-generator.py`. The tool regenerates files in `platform-web/docs`.

  * Create a Pull Request for generated docs. Make sure that the docs PR passes CI checks.
