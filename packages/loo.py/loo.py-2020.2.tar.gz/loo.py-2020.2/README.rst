Loopy: Transformation-Based Generation of High-Performance CPU/GPU Code
=======================================================================

``loo.py`` used to be the name on the package index for `Loopy
<https://github.com/inducer/loopy>`__, however as of release
2020.2, the package has moved to just `loopy <https://pypi.org/project/loopy/>`__,
a name that matches its module name.
