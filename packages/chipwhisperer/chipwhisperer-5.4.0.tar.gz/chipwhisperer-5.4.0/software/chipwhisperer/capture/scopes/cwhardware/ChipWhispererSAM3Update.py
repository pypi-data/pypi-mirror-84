    """ Object for easy reprogramming of ChipWhisperers

    This will work with the Lite, the Pro, and
    the Nano. If the ChipWhisperer has already been erased, pass None instead
    of the scope object and skip the enter_bootloader() call. Will also work
    for the CW305.

    Example:

     #. Attach the scope part of the hardware to your computer.

     #. Connect to the scope using::

            import chipwhisperer as cw

            # Connect to scope
            scope = cw.scope()

            # If using CW305, connect to target as well
            # Can ignore msg about no bitstream
            target = cw.target(None, cw.targets.CW305)

     #. Place the hardware in bootloader mode using::

            # use created scope object from previous step
            programmer = cw.SAMFWLoader(scope=scope)

            # or CW305 target object
            programmer = cw.SAMFWLoader(scope=target)

            # WARNING: this will erase the firmware on the device
            # and make it unusable until reprogrammed.
            programmer.enter_bootloader(really_enter=True)

     #. Unplug then plug in the hardware into your computer again.
        The device should be shown as BOSSA in the device manager
        on Windows. Make not of the port number the BOSSA device
        is attached to (for example: COM1, or COM2, and so on)

     #. Program the SAM3U with::

            import chipwhisperer as cw
            programmer = cw.SAMFWLoader(scope=None)

        Two methods:

         #. Using the firmware_path::

                # the firmware file is included with chipwhisperer 
                # and is the .bin file from the FW build
                # (ChipWhisperer Lite) chipwhisperer\hardware\capture\chipwhisperer-lite\sam3u_fw\SAM3U_VendorExample\Debug 
                # directory. 
                programmer.program(<port>, <path to firmware file>)

         #. Using the hardware_type (recommended)::

                programmer.program(<port>, hardware_type='cwlite')
                programmer.program(<port>, hardware_type='cwnano')
                programmer.program(<port>, hardware_type='cw305')
                programmer.program(<port>, hardware_type='cw1200')

        On Linux instead of 'COM#' use the Linux equivalent (usually /dev/ttyACM# or /dev/ttyUSB#)

     #. Once the programming is done. Unplug then plug in the hardware into your
        computer again. The device should show up as a ChipWhisperer again.
