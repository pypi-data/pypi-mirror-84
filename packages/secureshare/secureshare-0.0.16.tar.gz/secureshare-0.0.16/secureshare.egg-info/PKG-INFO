Description:  secureshare
        
        Simple secure file sharing personal server, Docker/Kubernetes compatible.
        
        ## Installing
        
        ```
        pip3 install secureshare
        ```
        
        SQL database is required. Supported and tested:
        
        * SQLite
        * MySQL
        * PostgreSQL
        
        Docker image: https://hub.docker.com/r/altertech/secureshare
        
        (config should be mounted as /config/secureshare.yml)
        
        ## Client
        
        https://github.com/alttch/sshare
        
        ```
        pip3 install sshare
        ```
        
        ## Usage without a client on 3rd party servers:
        
        ```
        # generate one-time token
        sshare c:token
        # upload desired file
        curl -v -F 'oneshot=1' -F 'file=@path/to/file' -Hx-auth-key:GENERATED_TOKEN https://YOUR_DOMAIN/u
        ```
        
        ## Deleting files / tokens
        
        Uploaded files and tokens can be deleted with DELETE HTTP method (requires
        valid key)
        
        Files can be also deleted by specifying *?c=delete* URL ending (requires URL
        knowledge only)
        
        ## Security
        
        A shared file URL looks like:
        
        ```
            http://YOURDOMAIN/d/<ID>/<KEY>/<FILENAME>
        ```
        
        ID is used to locate file in the storage database. The database stores files
        encrypted (AES256), so the server can't decrypt a requested file without the
        complete generated URL.
        
        If the URL is lost, file decryption becomes impossible.
