Changing theta
==============

This example shows how to change parameter values according to new
``Theta0``.

For example, we have run some GADMA inference for YRI, CEU data (from
`Gutenkunst et al.
2009 <https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000695>`__):

.. code:: bash

    %%bash
    cat params
    rm -rf gadma_result


.. parsed-literal::

    Input file: YRI_CEU.fs
    Output directory: gadma_result
    Initial structure: 2,1
    Symmetric migrations: True
    Silence: True


.. code:: bash

    %%bash
    gadma -p params

    %%bash
    tail -n 18 gadma_result/GADMA.log

    You didn't specify theta at the beginning. If you want change it and rescale parameters, please see tutorial.
    
    Thank you for using GADMA!

All parameters are in genetic units as we have not set ``Theta0`` and
``Relative parameters: True`` in the ``params`` file. So now we want to
transform it. ``Theta0`` is the mutation flux that is the result of:

:math:`\theta_0 = 4 \mu L`,

where

-  :math:`\mu` - mutation rate per base per generation,

-  :math:`L` - length of sequence that was used to build data.

As data is from `Gutenkunst et al.
2009 <https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000695>`__
we could take this values from the paper:

-  :math:`\mu = 2.35 \cdot 10^{-8}`

-  :math:`L = 4.04 \cdot 10^6`

Then our
:math:`\theta_0 = 4 \cdot \mu \cdot L = 4 \cdot 2.35 \cdot 10^{-8} \cdot 4.04 \cdot 10^6 = 0.37976`

Translation
~~~~~~~~~~~

According to our log file ``GADMA.log`` we have the following parameters
of the demographic model: ``t1``, ``nu11``, ``s1``, ``t2``, ``nu21``,
``nu22``, ``m2_12``. The genetic units are following:

-  Time is in :math:`2 \cdot N_{ref}` generations.
-  Populations sizes are relative to :math:`N_{ref}`.
-  Migrations are in :math:`\frac{1}{2 \cdot N_{ref}}`
-  Fractions of splits of populations should not be translated.

:math:`N_{ref}` is reference size that is usually size of ancestral
population (it is so in GADMA) and could be received by:

:math:`N_{ref} = \frac{\theta}{\theta0}`

And :math:`\theta` is indicated in the output of our run. So we could
use the following function to translate our parameters:

.. code:: ipython3

    def translate(values, par_labels, N_ref):
        new_values = list()
        for value, label in zip(values, par_labels):
            if label.lower().startswith('t'):  # Time
                new_value = 2 * N_ref * value
            elif label.lower().startswith('n'):  # Population size
                new_value = N_ref * value
            elif label.lower().startswith('m'):  # Migration
                new_value = value / (2 * N_ref)
            else:  # Fractions
                new_value = value
            new_values.append(new_value)
        return new_values

Now let us get our parameters and theta from generated code of our best
model, get :math:`N_{ref}` and translate values:

.. code:: bash

    %%bash
    cp gadma_result/best_logLL_model_moments_code.py final_model_moments_code.py

.. code:: ipython3

    from final_model_moments_code import p0, theta
    par_labels = ['t1', 'nu11', 's1', 't2', 'nu21', 'nu22', 'm2_12']
    
    print(f"Labels of our parameters:\n{par_labels}")
    print(f"Values of our parameters:\n{p0}")
    print(f"Optimal theta:\n{theta}")
    
    # get N_ref
    N_ref = theta / 0.37976
    print(f"\nReference size:\n{int(N_ref)}")
    
    # Translate our parameters
    tr_values = translate(p0, par_labels, N_ref)
    print(f"\nTranslated values of our parameters:\n{tr_values}")
    
    # Print our parameters
    print("\nSo parameters of our demographic history are:")
    print(f"{par_labels[0]}\t=\t{int(tr_values[0])}\t-\t"
          "Time between ancestral population size growth/decrease and its split in generations.")
    print(f"{par_labels[1]}\t=\t{int(tr_values[1])}\t-\t"
          "Size of ancestral population after growth/decrease.")
    print(f"{par_labels[2]}\t=\t{tr_values[2]: .2f}\t-\t"
          "Fraction of ancestral population split. Defines initial sizes of populations after split.")
    print(f"{par_labels[3]}\t=\t{int(tr_values[3])}\t-\t"
          "Time of ancestral population split in generations.")
    print(f"{par_labels[4]}\t=\t{int(tr_values[4])}\t-\t"
          "Final size of population 1.")
    print(f"{par_labels[5]}\t=\t{int(tr_values[5])}\t-\t"
          "Final size of population 2.")
    print(f"{par_labels[6]}\t=\t{tr_values[6] : .2e}\t-\t"
          "Symmetric migration rate between population 1 and population 2.")


.. parsed-literal::

    Labels of our parameters:
    ['t1', 'nu11', 's1', 't2', 'nu21', 'nu22', 'm2_12']
    Values of our parameters:
    [5.0, 1.6017267183354083, 0.10231452390998837, 1.9450055497773657, 2.817456387415982, 0.559720261493847, 1.3258648052909567]
    Optimal theta:
    2072.518176089871
    
    Reference size:
    5457
    
    Translated values of our parameters:
    [54574.42005713795, 8741.330674317765, 0.10231452390998837, 21229.5099774029, 15376.10483795062, 3054.6408665256304, 0.00012147310075881814]
    
    So parameters of our demographic history are:
    t1	=	54574	-	Time between ancestral population size growth/decrease and its split in generations.
    nu11	=	8741	-	Size of ancestral population after growth/decrease.
    s1	=	 0.10	-	Fraction of ancestral population split. Defines initial sizes of populations after split.
    t2	=	21229	-	Time of ancestral population split in generations.
    nu21	=	15376	-	Final size of population 1.
    nu22	=	3054	-	Final size of population 2.
    m2_12	=	 1.21e-04	-	Symmetric migration rate between population 1 and population 2.
