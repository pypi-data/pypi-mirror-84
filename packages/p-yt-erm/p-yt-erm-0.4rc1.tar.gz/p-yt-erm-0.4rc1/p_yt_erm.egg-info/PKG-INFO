        youtube music player in the command line
        
        
        This program requires python3, the libraries in requirements.txt & vlc media player to be installed to work
        
        =============================================================================================================

        commandline options for main.py
        
        
        USAGE: python3 main.py [-p][-r][-v][-s] "Song1" "Song2"
        
        -p <filename>     // specify a file that contains a list of song names, one on each line
        -r <True/False>   // specify if you want to enable Discord Rich Presence
        -i <True/False>   // specify if you want to enable input
        -v <int>          // specify the volume level
        -s                // enabled playlist shuffling
        -a                // enable forcing ytplayer to use audiostreams* 
        -d                // enables debug logging
        -l                // enables infinite playlist looping
        
        
        *this can cause playback issues on some videos but might offer better audio quality
        
        =============================================================================================================
        
        examples:
        
        
        python3 main.py -p playlist.txt 
        // plays all the songs in playlist.txt in descending order
        
        python3 main.py -v 50 "foals spanish sahara"
        // plays the song "spaish sahara" at volume level 50
        
        python3 main.py -s -p playlist.txt
        // plays the songs in playlist.txt in random order
        
        pythhon3 main.py -p playlist.txt "foals spanish sahara" "icicles the scary jokes"
        // plays the songs "spanish sahara" & "icicles" before playing everything in playlist.txt
        
        
        ============================================================================================================
        
        ytplayer can be used on its own in different scripts by importing it
        
        view the source code to get a vague idea how it works
        
        =============================================================================================================
        
        jk heres a quick rundown
        
        
        
        ---- initial setup ----
        
        first step is to import it (obv)
        
        >	import ytplayer
        
        now make a new instance of the player by creating the object variable. Decide if you want to supress output or enable debug info.
        Enabling debug will always disable quiet mode too
        
        >	player = ytplayer.YtPlayer(quiet=False,debug=False,vlclogs=False,forceaudiostream=False)
        // quiet determines if it prints song info when a song gets played
        // debug determines if some debug prints get printed
        // vlclogs enabled/disables vlclib logging
        // forceaudiostream determines if playing a song will always use the audiostream [See note in commandline options up above]
        
        thats all the setup you need.
        
        
        ---- playing songs ----
        
        There are several ways of playing songs:
        
        >	YtPlayer.play(query,wait=True)
        // this will search for the 'query' search terms and immediatly play the top result. Enabling 'wait' means it will sleep until the song is finished.
        
        
        >	YtPlayer.playPlaylist(songlist,shuffle=False) 
        // very similar to play, but for multiple song. it will play every song in the list 'songlist'. Enable shuffle to randomise the order of songs.
        
        
        >	YtPlayer._vlcPlay(url)
        // this is more backend-ish but if you really want to play an audio file from the web directly and for some reason dont want to use python-vlc on it's own, use this.
        
        
        >	YtPlayer.search(query)
        // this doesnt actually play anything, but it returns the highest quality youtube audio url for the top search result of the query. Could be useful if you want to use a different audio library instead of vlc i suppose.
        
        
        ---- controlling playback ----
        
        >	YtPlayer.pause():
        // pauses playback
        
        >	YtPlayer.unpause():
        // resumes playback
        
        >	YtPlayer.stop():
        // stops playback entirely
        
        >	YtPlayer.setVolume(volumenum):
        // this will set the volume to the int given as long as it is between 0-200
        There are two other ways to change the volume, both applicable to niche uses
        The fist would be to overwrite 'YtPlayer._volumeLvl'. This would change the volume level to the one specified when the next song in the playlist starts playing.
        The other option is to call 'YtPlayer.vlcPlayer.audio_set_volume(volumenum)'. This changes the vlc volume for the *current song only* and will be changed back to the _volumeLvl value when the next song plays.
        
        
        ---- finer playback controls ----
        
        i decided not to wrap the entire python-vlc library needlessly, because it is still acessible.
        You can access any vlc function by calling the 'YtPlayer.vlcPlayer' or 'YtPlayer.vlcInstance' objects
        
        
        ---- getting playback info ----
        
        both 'YtPlayer.YtInfo' & 'YtPlayer._ydl_info' are exposed. You may use either to get pretty much any info about the youtube video.
        
        >	YtPlayer.getTimeStamp()
        if you happen to need a nicely formatted current timestamp + the complete length of the current video, use this. It will return a tuple like this '(MM:SS,MM:SS)' where [0] is current time and [1] is total lenght
