```

When in the player is active you can control it via typing in the command letters above to do the function shown with them.
A few examples are below.

In this example the volume is changed by entering `v <volume percent wanted>`

```text
Controls: [v]olume,[s]kip,[prev]ious,[p]ause,[m]ove,[t]imestamp,[g]oto,[e]xit

v 75
```

In this example the player head is moved by entering `g <Â± seconds to move>`
```text
Controls: [v]olume,[s]kip,[prev]ious,[p]ause,[m]ove,[t]imestamp,[g]oto,[e]xit

## Using pYTrerm as a library

**ALL LIBRARY FUNCTIONS AND CLASSES ARE STILL UNDERDEVELOPENT AND MAY NOT WORK OR BEHAVIORS MAY CHANGE.**

pYTerm is able to be imported as a library how you would with any other python library:
```py
#!/usr/bin/python3
from pYTerm import pYTerm
```
The next thing to do is to make a player object and you are ready to use the methods ~~when they are working~~.
