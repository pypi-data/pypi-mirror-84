# graspologic-native

[graspologic](https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic) is a python package for graph statistics. 

Some functionality can be best served if compiled into a python native module, both for performance purposes and to 
share that functionality with web assembly.

`graspologic-native` is a repository that holds Rust packages. The core packages will be published as crate libraries, 
and a package using [pyo3](https://github.com/pyo3/pyo3) will expose the functionality of that library to Python.  

## Requirements
- Rust nightly 1.37+ (we are currently using 1.40)
- Python 3.5+ (we are currently using 3.8)
- 64 bit operating system

## Published Versions
We currently build for x86_64 platforms only, Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu, for python versions 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9.
