#Skill:  Make potion of slavery [9550]
#
Usage:  USE @@@@

Required:  one ratspider venom [63]
Time:      seven days

The alchemist brews a potion which, when ingested by a character,
causes that character to become a servant of the alchemist.
The unfortunate noble will swear fealty to the alchemist and
promise to do his bidding.

Use of the potion is dangerous:  there is a 33% chance that
the noble who drinks it will die.

The rare and highly poisonous ratspider venom is used in the
preparation of this potion.  Upon completion, the new potion
will be added to the alchemist's inventory.  The potion will,
of course, be unlabeled.

A character wishing to drink the potion should specify it
to the USE order.  For instance, to drink potion [601], issue
the order:  USE 601.

The creator of a potion must have the necessary NPs to assume
control of the character who drinks the slavery potion.  The
previous owner of the unfortunate character will have their
NPs returned.
