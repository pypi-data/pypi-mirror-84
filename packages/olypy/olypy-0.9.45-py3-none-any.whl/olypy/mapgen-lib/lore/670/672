#Skill:  Persuade oathbound noble [672]
#
Usage:   USE @@@@ <target> [flag]
Time:    seven days

Attempt to persuade an oathbound noble to defect.  There is
only a chance of success when used on oath-1 nobles.  Oath-2
nobles will not leave their lord under any circumstances.

@@@@ costs 25 gold per use, to pay for gifts, fine meals, handsome
clothing, and other props useful in the persuasion attempt.

Each seven day use yields a 2% chance of success.

If flag is 1, and the persuasion attempt is successful, the target
character will stack with the persuading character.

In order to assume control over a new noble, the persuader
must pay the number of NPs which have been invested in the
desired character.  The previous owner will receive these
NPs when ownership of the character is lost.
