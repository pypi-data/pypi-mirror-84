#Skill:  Rally peasants to cause [9538]
Usage:  RALLY <mob>
Time:   seven days

Deliver a fiery speech to an existing crowd of peasants, causing them
to stack with the noble.  They will remain with the noble for three
months.  The mob must be specified as an argument to RALLY.

Use of @@@@ on a mob already stacked with the noble will renew the
peasants' enthusiasm, and add an additional three months to the time
they will remain stacked, to a maximum of five months.

Mobs stacked with the noble may not be given any orders, but will
participate in any combat the noble encounters.
