You discover a dull wrought-iron crown, crudely fashioned.  When
you place it upon your head, you sense the presence of several
bands of barbarians nearby.  You find these units will respond to
your mental control, and you can issue the following commands to
your barbarian units:

   ADMIT, ATTACK, BANNER, BEHIND, CONTACT, DEFAULT, DEFEND, DROP,
   EXECUTE, FLAG, GIVE, HOSTILE, MOVE, NAME, NEUTRAL, PILLAGE,
   PROMOTE, RAZE, SEEK, STACK, STOP, TAKE, TERRORIZE, UNSTACK, WAIT
