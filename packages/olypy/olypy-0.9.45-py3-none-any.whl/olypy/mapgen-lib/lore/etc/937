Faery hills sometimes exist simultaneously in both Faery and
the outside world.  If one knows where they are, they can be
forced to appear with the elfstone.  To use the elfstone,
issue the order USE @@@@ in a province containing a Faery hill
which is not currently accessible.  The hill will be summoned,
and passage between Faery and the mortal world will be possible.

Faery hills remain until the end of the month.

Elfstones are also said to guarantee safe passage to travelers
in Faery.
