The Crown of Prosperity was once worn by the most
prosperous mortal to ever rule in Olympia, King Damar.
Damar now wears his crown in the underworld and
reflects on his past adventures of long ago, before
the first Great Ending swept away all that he knew,
and carried him from his beloved city of Kircarth to
the land of the dead.

Sometimes nobles are able to acquire the Crown and hold
it for a time.  The crown infuses whatever province it
ends each turn in with a measure of prosperity and
economic health, equivalent to a +2 increase in the
province's civilization level.

However, this prosperity does not last forever, for
King Damar's ghostly hand invariably will reach out
from the underworld to reclaim his relic.  The Crown
can be expected to return to its rightful owner 8-16
turns after its appearance in the mortal world.
