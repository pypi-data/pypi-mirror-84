# lore_orb [9006]
#
The orb may be used to gain visions of characters, items, or
places.  Issue the order USE @@@@ <target> to scry the given
target with the orb.

The orb may only be used once each month, and yields success two
out of three times it is used.  Orbs wear out and shatter after
3-9 successful uses; the actual number varies from orb to orb.
