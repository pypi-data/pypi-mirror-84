The most feared of the ancients was a wizard of
terrible power known as Bastrestric ther Archymonaged.
Bastrestric routinely incinerated his foes (or anyone 
who offended him) with bursts of raw aura energy
directed from his black tower in the castle built on
Mt. Olympus.

Though he was the most powerful living mage in the
known world, and by any measure a fearsome, unholy
force, Bastrestric yearned for ever greater abilities.
He felt increasingly constrained by the limits of his
mortal body, and thus in time resolved to abandon it.
BtA's spirit jumped free of his body, plunging directly
into the aura rivers which bind together the deepest
structures of the very world itself.  Only a scorched,
empty body was left behind in his tower.

BtA's spirit has passed on, but the remants of his
mortal body continue to radiate intense power.

Use of BtA's skull (USE @@@@) causes an intense aura
burst which a mage will attempt to absorb.  If successful,
the mage will gain a 50-75 boost to current aura (within
the limit of 5 times the mage's maximum aura).

There is a 25% chance that the mage will be killed by
use of the skull.  Non-mages who use the skull will be
instantly killed.

BtA's skull will vanish with use, or within 10-20 turns
after appearing in the mortal world.
