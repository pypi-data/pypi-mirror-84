#Spell:  Tap health for aura [9126]
#
Usage:  USE @@@@ <amount of aura>

Required aura:  none
Time to cast:   seven days

The mage will dip into his own health to generate current aura.
The health loss received is equal to five times the amount of
aura generated.

For example, USE @@@@ 10 would generate 10 points of current aura,
and cause the mage to receive a 50 point wound.

Use of this spell is dangerous, as any wound runs the risk of
infection, and death could result.  See the section on Health
in the rules for more information about wounds and healing.
