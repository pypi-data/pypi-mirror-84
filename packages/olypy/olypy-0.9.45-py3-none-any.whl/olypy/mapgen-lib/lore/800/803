#Spell:  Appear common [9104]

Usage:  USE @@@@ <aura>

Required aura:  as given
Time to cast:   one day

The caster expends aura to conceal the fact that he is a magician.
Nobles who possess magical powers are identified to others in the turn
reports with a tag:

        max aura        tag
        --------        ---
          5-10          mage
         11-16          wizard
          17+           sorcerer

Use of @@@@ allows the tag to be suppressed for a number of turns
equal to the amount of aura invested in the cast.

Uses of @@@@ are addititive.  A mage with 4 turns of concealment
remaining who ordered "use @@@@ 3" would have a total of seven turns
of concealment.
