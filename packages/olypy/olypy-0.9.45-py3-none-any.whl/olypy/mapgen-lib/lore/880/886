#Spell:  Curse noncreator loyalty [9113]
#
Usage:  USE @@@@ <artifact> [aura]

Required aura:  one or more points, as given
Required item:
Time to cast:   fourteen days

Curses a forged magical artifact such that possession by any
character other than the creator will cause that character's
loyalty to erode.  The amount of loyalty lost is proportional
to the aura invested with @@@@.

For example, USE @@@@ 8192 10 would place a ten aura noncreator
curse on artifact [8192].  Anyone except the artifact's creator
would lose ten points of loyalty each turn that they held the
object.

The actual loss of loyalty will occur on a random day during
the month.

Multiple uses of @@@@ on the same artifact are additive.

Aura defaults to one.
