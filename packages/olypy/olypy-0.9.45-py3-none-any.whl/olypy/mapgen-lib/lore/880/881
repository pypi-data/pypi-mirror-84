#Spell:  Forge auraculum [9102]
#
Usage:  USE @@@@ <aura-level> "Name"

Required aura:   as specified by caster
Required items:  500 gold, 1 mithril
Time to cast:    fourteen days

Forge a magical auraculum, giving it the specified name.

   An auraculum is a magical artifact which concentrates and amplifies
   a mage's power.  A permanent investment of maximum aura is made when
   constructing the auraculum.  The artifact doubles the invested aura.
   However, since a portion of the mage's pneuma has been bound in the
   auraculum, it is important to safeguard it from being lost or stolen.

In addition to depleting the caster's current aura level, the specified
aura amount will be permanently removed from the magician's maximum aura
rating.  The new object, while possessed by its maker, will augment the
mage's maximum aura rating by twice the amount of aura invested in its
creation.

Possession of an auraculum doubles the amount of aura a mage naturally
recovers each month, from two points to four.

Creation of an auraculum also grants knowledge of the Advanced sorcery
magical skill category.  Advanced sorcery may not be learned in any
other way.

Example:

   A mage of current aura level 10, maximum aura 10 who issues
   USE @@@@ 5 "Ring of power" will be reduced to current aura level 5,
   maximum aura level 5.  However, the new artifact will add 10 points
   to the maximum aura rating of its creator, but only while it is in
   his possession.

       Current aura:   10
       Maximum aura:   10

    1: > use @@@@ 5 "Ring of power"
    1: Attempt to forge an auraculum.
       ...
   14: Created Ring of power [js80].
   14: Learned Advanced sorcery [166].

       Current aura:   5
       Maximum aura:   15 (5+10)
 
Characters other than the auraculum's creator do not receive an aura
bonus from possession of the object.

Since the mage has bound a portion of his aura into the artifact, its
destruction would deal him an instant, fatal blow.  Thus, the creator
of such an object should use all means to prevent it from being lost
or stolen.  However, magical items of such power are hard to destroy.
An auraculum may only be destroyed in the province in which it was
created.

This spell may only be used once.  A magician may only create one
auraculum during his lifetime.

The creator of the artifact may change its name later with the
NAME order.  The object must be possessed in order to rename it.

   > name js80 "Wooden staff"
   Ring of power [js80] will now be known as Wooden staff [js80].
