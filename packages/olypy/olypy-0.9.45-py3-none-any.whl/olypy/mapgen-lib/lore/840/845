Spell:  Create magical barrier [9160]

Usage:  USE @@@@ [aura]

Required aura:  one to eight points
Required item:
Time to cast:   ten days

Erects a magical barrier which prevents anyone from entering the
location.  The barrier will lose one point of aura at the end of
each turn, and will dissipate when it has no aura remaining.

For example, USE @@@@ 1 will create a barrier over the location
which lasts until the end of the turn.  USE @@@@ 2 will create
a barrier which lasts until the end of the next turn.

Multiple casts of @@@@ are additive.

A barrier which achieves eight points of aura becomes permanent.
Permanent barriers do not decay at the end of each month.  They
may only be removed by a magician.

Aura defaults to one.
