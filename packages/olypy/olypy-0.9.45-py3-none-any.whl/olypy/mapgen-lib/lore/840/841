Spell:  Scry location [9141]

Usage:  USE @@@@ <location> [aura]

Required aura:  one or more points, as given
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

Grants the mage a vision of the specified place, no matter
how far away he might be.

If the target location is magically shrouded from scry attempts,
sufficient aura must be used for @@@@ to pierce the shroud.
For example, a location shroud of three aura would require
USE @@@@ <location> 4 to overcome (costing four aura to cast).

It is not possible to scry a netherworld location (a location in
Hades or Faery) from the real world, or vice-versa.

The default aura to use is one point.
