The craftsman constructs a battering ram by selecting a large,
heavy tree trunk, sharpening the end somewhat and plating it
with iron, and then suspending it in a movable wooden frame
such that it may be swung back and forth against walls or gates.

The frame receives an iron plated roof to protect the operators
from boiling oil or pitch, rocks, or other missile weapons hurled
down upon them by the enemy.
