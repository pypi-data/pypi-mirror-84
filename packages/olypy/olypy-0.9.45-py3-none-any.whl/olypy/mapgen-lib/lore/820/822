#Spell:  Bind storm to ship [9134]
#
Usage:  BIND <storm>

Required aura:  three points
Time to cast:   seven days

Bind an existing storm to a ship.  The caster must be the owner of
the storm (having summoned it himself, or siezed control of it),
and must be on the ship the storm is to be bound to.

Subsequent movement of the ship will cause the storm to follow.
This can be especially useful if a wind storm is bound to a
roundship, as the roundship will enjoy faster travel while the
aura of the wind storm lasts.
