#Spell:  Fierce wind [9124]
#
Usage:  USE @@@@ <storm> <target> [aura]

Required aura:  none
Time to cast:   seven days

Use a wind storm to damage a building or a ship.  The target will
be buffeted with fierce winds, causing an amount of damage to the
target equal to the amount of the wind storm's aura spent in the
attack.

For example, "USE @@@@ <storm> ce90 5" would cause <storm> to spend
five of its remaining aura points against target [ce90], causing
five points of damage.

If aura is not specified, the storm will expend all of its remaining
energy in the attack.  The mage does not need to be in the same
location as the storm.
