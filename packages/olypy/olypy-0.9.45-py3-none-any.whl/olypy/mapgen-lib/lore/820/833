Usage:  USE @@@@ <storm> <target> [aura]

Required aura:  none

Use a fog to kill an enemy target's men.  Only peasants, soldiers,
crossbowmen, workers and sailors are vulnerable to death by fog.
Two of the target's men are killed for each point of the storm's
aura used.  If aura is not given, all of the remaining strength of
the storm will be used.

The caster does not need to be in the same location as the fog to
cast this spell.
