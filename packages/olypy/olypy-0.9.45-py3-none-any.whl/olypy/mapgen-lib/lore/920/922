#Spell:  Teleport item [9202]
#
Usage:  USE @@@@ <to-who> <item> [qty] [have-left]

Required aura:   three points + one per 250 weight
Time to cast:    three days

Teleport quantity of an item in inventory to another character.
Specifying zero for quantity will cause the unit to teleport all
of its inventory of the item.  An amount specified by have-left
will be retained.

For example, if Feasel has 100 gold [1]:

        USE @@@@ 5499 1 50          #  Send 50 gold to [5499]
        USE @@@@ 5499 1 0           #  Send all 100 gold to [5499]
        USE @@@@ 5499 1 100         #  Send all 100 gold to [5499]
        USE @@@@ 5499 1 100 25      #  Send 75 gold to [5499]
        USE @@@@ 5499 1 0 25        #  Send 75 gold to [5499]

Three points of aura are required to teleport items, plus one extra
point of aura for each 250 units of weight to be sent.

Use of @@@@ is subject to the same permission checks as GIVE.
