Usage:  USE @@@@ <gate> <key>

Required aura:  six points
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

Seal the gate with the given key.  The gate must be present in
the current location, and must not already be sealed.

The key is a numeric password which will be required for further
access to the gate for jumps or other manipulations.  Only those
who supply the key number will be granted access.  The number
should be between 1 and 999.

    For example, if Gate [8192] is sealed with USE 9117 8192 123
    then the key "123" must be supplied as a parameter to the
    jump spell, or the jump will fail.
