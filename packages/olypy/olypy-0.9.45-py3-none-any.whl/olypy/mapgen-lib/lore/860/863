Required aura:  two points
Required item:  blank scroll [84]

The Ancients were a race of wise, powerful men who walked the lands
long before the modern inhabitants had arrived.  Their language is
heavy and descriptive, well suited to expressing their detailed and
complex thoughts.

Transcribe the given spell onto a blank scroll.  The blank scroll will
be consumed, and a new unique scroll will be produced.  The scroll will
permit one character to learn the spell from the scroll.

Example:

    USE @@@@ nnnn       # make a one-time study scroll for spell nnnn

Only Gatecraft [860] spells may be scribed with this skill.

The spell must be known by the character in order to be written.
The character will still know the spell after it has been scribed.

This spell requires as much time to cast as the skill takes to learn.
It takes two weeks to write a spell which requires two weeks of study
to learn.
