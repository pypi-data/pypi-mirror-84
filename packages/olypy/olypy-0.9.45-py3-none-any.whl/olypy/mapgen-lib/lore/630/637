Usage:  TORTURE <prisoner>
Time:   seven days

Torture is the practice of inflicting pain on a captive prisoner in
order to extract information against the victim's will.

Torture will attempt to learn what faction the prisoner belongs to.
Each torture attempt inflicts a 50 point health loss on the prisoner.

The chance of success depends on the prisoner's loyalty:

	loyalty		chance
	-------		------
	oath-2		  0%
	oath-1		 10%
	contract	 50%
	fear		100%
