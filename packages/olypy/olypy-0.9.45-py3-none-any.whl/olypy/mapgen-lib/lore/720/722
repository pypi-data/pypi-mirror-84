Gold is widely accepted as a currency in Olympia.  Its
scarcity lends gold a high value, but it is not so rare
that it cannot be used in the everyday exchange of goods.
It has a high value, but weighs little, and thus is easy to
carry.  Gold is also readily assayable to guarantee its value.

The character must be in a mine shaft to USE @@@@.  The mine's
monthly yield of gold will be obtained.  Once mined, no further
gold can be mined until the next month.

Use of this skill will cause the mine shaft to become one-third
of a level deeper.

The quantity of gold obtained will vary with the depth of the
shaft.
