#Skill:  Fight to the death [9505]
Usage:   USE @@@@ <0|1>
Time:    0 days

Normally a side will break when its offensive plus defensive total
falls by 50% or more.  Knowledge of @@@@ allows a leader to override
this default break point and set it to 100% instead.

    Break at 50% losses:   USE @@@@ 1  (default)
    Fight to the death:    USE @@@@ 0

During combat, only the stack leader's setting for @@@@ is checked.
@@@@ works both for attacking and defending stacks.

Note that prisoners may still be taken from a side fighting to the
death, as wounded nobles may be too weak to resist being taken
captive.
