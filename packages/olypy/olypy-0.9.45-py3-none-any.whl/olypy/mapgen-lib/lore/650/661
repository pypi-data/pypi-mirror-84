Usage:  USE @@@@
Time:   28 days

Breed and train for service one hound [295].

There is a 50% chance that a given hound will bark
if any stealth characters enter the same location as
the character containing the hound.  Hounds also have
a 50% chance of barking once per month (on a random day)
if any stealth characters are present in the current
location.

Hounds halve the chance that prisoners will escape from the
stack, and will bark each time an escape attempt is foiled.
