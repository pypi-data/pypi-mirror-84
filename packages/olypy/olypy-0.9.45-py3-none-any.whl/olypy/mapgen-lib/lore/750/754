Resurrect dead noble [@@@@] must be performed by a priest
in a temple.  The priest must be holding the body of the
dead noble.  There is a 50% chance of success for each
attempt.

If successful, the character will be restored to full
health in the priest's location, and be under the
command of the original owner.

The defense rating of the resurrected noble will be
lowered by 50 points.  If the noble would have a new
defense rating lower than 1, resurrection is not
possible.
