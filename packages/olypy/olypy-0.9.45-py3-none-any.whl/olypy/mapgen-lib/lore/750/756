#Skill:  Immunity from Vision [756]
#
Usage:  USE @@@@ [target]
Time:   ten days

Immunity from Vision allows a character to prevent scrys
from the Receive Vision [751] skill, and when they
succeed, to detect the identity of the visioning priest.

Each use of [@@@@] increases the vision defense count
of the target character by one point.  If a target is
not specified, [@@@@] works on the priest himself.

A vision attempt by a priest will fail if the count is 1
or higher, and decrease the count by one.  If the count
is zero, a vision by another priest against the
character will succeed.

Characters with Immunity from Vision [@@@@] will be
notified of vision attempts against them, and will
learn the identity of the visioning priest.

Vision defense point are only deceased in response to
a vision attempt from another priest.  The current
vision defense level will be listed in the character's
turn report.
