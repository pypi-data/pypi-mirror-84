#Skill:  Aura blast [9185]
#
Usage:  USE @@@@ <target> [aura] [have-left]

Required aura:  as given
Time to cast:   one day

The mage directs a blast of raw energy at the target character.
The target will suffer two points of damage for each point of
aura used in the blast.  For example, USE @@@@ 5201 25 would
send a blast of 25 aura at [5201], causing a 50 point wound.

If aura is zero, all available current aura will be used.  If
have-left is given, at least that much current aura will be
retained, and not used for the blast

It is not possible to aura blast between Hades, Faery and
the real world.
