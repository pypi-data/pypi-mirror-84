#Spell:  Summon wind [9188]
#
Usage:  USE @@@@ <aura> ["Name of storm"]

Required aura:  three or more points
Time to cast:   seven days

Summon a wind weather entity.  Wind may be summoned from plains,
ocean, mountain or desert provinces.  Once a location has produced
a wind entity, another wind may not be summoned from that place
until the first has dissipated.

The wind entity will have a strength of twice the amount of aura
invested in its summoning.  Wind loses one point of strength at
the end of each month.  When a wind entity's strength reaches zero,
it dissipates.

While the wind exists, the summoner will get a location report
the province that it is in.
