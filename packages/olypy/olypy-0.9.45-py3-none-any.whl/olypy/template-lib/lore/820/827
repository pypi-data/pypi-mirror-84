#Spell:  Direct storm [9190]
#
Usage:  USE @@@@ <storm> <direction or destination>

Required aura:  none
Time to cast:   one day

Direct an existing storm which the caster has previously summoned
to move to an adjacent province at the end of the month.  Storms
only move once per month, and may only exist at the province level
(they may not move into sublocations or buildings.)

The caster need not be in the same location as the storm in order
to direct it.

At the end of the month, the storm will move to its new province,
and the mage will receive a report for the storm's new location.
