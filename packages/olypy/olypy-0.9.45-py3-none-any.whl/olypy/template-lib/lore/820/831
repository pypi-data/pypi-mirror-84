Use a rain storm to deliver a lightning bolt against a target in the
province.  Aura is the amount of storm strength to deliver in the
blast.  If aura is not specified, the storm will expend all of its
remaining engery in the bolt.  The mage does not need to be in the
same location as the storm.

The lightning bolt may be delivered against any building or character
directly in the storm's province.  It will do an amount of damage
equal to the strength of the bolt.
