#Spell:  Summon ghost warriors [9179]
#
Usage:  MAKE 18 [days]

Required aura:  one point per day
Time to cast:   as given

Each day of summoning requires one point of aura, and yields two
ghost warriors.

Ghost warriors [18] are spirits of dead soldiers summoned to fight
again on the battlefield.  They have no substance, and thus are
ineffectual attackers.  Opponents will still select them in combat,
however, so they are useful for absorbing enemy hits.

Ghost warriors have a attack and defense values of zero.  One hit
by any attacker will cause them to vanish.

One ghost warrior returns to the Land of the Dead at the end of
each month.
