#Spell:  Transcend death [9125]
#
Usage:   automatic when needed

Transcend death allows a mortal to pass through Hades unmolested
by the foul and dangerous spirits who live there.  The necromancer
must be alone, however.  He cannot be stacked with any other
nobles, or be accompanied by any followers.

It is also said that when a necromancer with knowledge of @@@@ dies,
the body vanishes, and the mage is recreated somewhere in Hades,
albeit lacking any of his worldly possessions.
