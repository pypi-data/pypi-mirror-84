#Skill:  Summon demon lord [9181]
#
Usage:  USE @@@@ [aura]

Required aura:  three to eight points
Time to cast:   seven days

Summon a demon lord unit from a graveyard.  The demon lord will
appear with 15-25 undead and stack with the summoner.

Each graveyard will support the summoning of one demon lord.  No
further demon lord units may be summoned from a graveyard until
the graveyard's demon lord has been destroyed or banished.

The amount of aura invested in the summoning determines the
strength of the demon lord.  The default aura is three points.

	aura	attack/defense
	----	--------------
	 3	  (100,100)
	 4	  (150,150)
	 5	  (190,190)
	 6	  (220,220)
	 7	  (240,240)
	 8	  (250,250)

Each undead accompanying the demon lord fights with attack-10,
defense-10.

The demon lord's service is secured with a bond which lasts five
months, unless renewed.  Demon lords should be banished or have
their bonds renewed before the five months expires, or they may
exercise their wrath on the summoner.

Other Necromatic spells provide for banishment of demon lords and
renewal of their loyalty bonds.
