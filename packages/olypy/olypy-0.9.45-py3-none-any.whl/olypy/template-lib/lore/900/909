#Skill:  Absorb aura blast [9186]
#
Usage:  USE @@@@ <flag>

Required aura:  none
Time to cast:   zero days

Knowledge of @@@@ will, by default, cause the mage to absorb any
blasts of aura instead of being harmed by them.  If absorbed,
half of the aura used in the blast will be added to the aura
of the mage being blasted.

Instead of absorbing aura, the blast may be reflected back to the
attacker.  To set this option, specify a flag of 1:

	use @@@@ 1	# reflect aura blasts back at attacker
	use @@@@ 0	# absorb aura blasts into current aura

Aura blasts may only be reflected once.  If a blast is reflected back
to an attacker with knowledge of @@@@, the attacker will be harmed,
and will not absorb or reflect the blast.
