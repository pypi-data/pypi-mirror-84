#Skill:  Renew demon bond [9182]

Usage:  USE @@@@ <target>

Required aura:  three points
Time to cast:   seven days

Renew the loyalty bond for a demon lord.  This spell will cause
the demon lord to remain stacked with its summoner for an additional
four months.  Demon lord loyalty bonds accumulate to a maximum of
eight months.

It is wise to keep a demon lord's loyalty bond renewed, lest it
erode completely, and the demon unit turns on its master.
