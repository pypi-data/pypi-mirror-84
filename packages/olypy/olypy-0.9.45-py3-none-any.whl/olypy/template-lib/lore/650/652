#Skill: Capture beasts in battle [9506]
#
Usage:  automatic when needed

Wild animals will ordinarily fight to the death.  Nobles who enter
combat with these creatures must either kill them, or be killed
themselves.

Beastmasters with knowledge of @@@@, however, can capture rather
than kill these wild animals.  The skilled beastmaster will lure
the animal into a trap, or carefully engage it until the beast
becomes exhausted.  If a group of many beasts is attacked, most
beasts will die during battle, leaving a few (or sometimes none)
for the beastmaster to capture.

@@@@ is used automatically whenever the character attacks (or is
attacked by) one of the following wild beasts:

$capturable_animals

To capture wild beasts, the noble should ATTACK them.  A regular
combat will occur, and the noble's stack may suffer casualties.
@@@@ does not change the progress of battle, or the outcome if
the noble loses.

If the noble is victorious, however, instead of the wild beasts
being destroyed, their unit wrapper will be disbanded, and the
beast items will be added to the noble's inventory.

The beastmaster need not be the stack leader for @@@@ to work.
However, the stack leader will always receive the booty.

For example:  suppose Osswid is stacked over Feasel, and Feasel
knows @@@@, but Osswid doesn't.  Beasts will be captured in
battle, but they will go into Osswid's inventory, not Feasel's.
