Usage:  USE @@@@
Time:   seven days

Must be used in an inn.  The character will chat with the local
patrons of the inn, inquiring as to the recent comings and goings
of other nearby characters, paying special attention to clues
which would indicate the presence of wealthy units.

Use of @@@@ will reveal the identity of the richest noble within
three provinces of the inn.  Any character with less than 500
gold is not considered wealthy, and is ignored by @@@@.
