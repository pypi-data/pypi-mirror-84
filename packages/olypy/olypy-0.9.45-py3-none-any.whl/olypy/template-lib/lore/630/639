#Skill:  Sneak into structure [9574]
#
Usage:  SNEAK [building or ship]
Time:   three days

The character will sneak into the specified building or ship.
Once inside, other occupants of the structure will see the
character in their location reports, unless the unit employs
additional methods of concealment.  Occupants will not see the
character enter, however.

To exit the structure by the same means, use SNEAK with no
arguments.

The unit must be alone in order to sneak into and out of buildings
or ships.  It may not be stacked with any other characters, or
possess any followers, such as peasants, soldiers, workers, etc.
