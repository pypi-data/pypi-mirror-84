Notify the caster of the identity of any mages jumping through the
specified gate.  The gate must be present in the current location
to apply this spell.  However, the caster will be notified if the
gate is used, wherever he may be at the time.

Only one [@@@@] spell may be active on a gate at a time.  Casting
this spell on a gate already notifying another mage of jumps will
displace the previous mage's spell.
