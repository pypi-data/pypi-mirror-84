Remove the seal from a gate by supplying the key.  The key will
no longer be required for jumps through the gate.

    For example, if Gate [8192] were sealed with key "123",
    the spell USE @@@@ 8192 123 would unseal the gate.
    Jumps through the gate could proceed without supplying
    the key.
