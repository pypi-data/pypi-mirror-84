hold of it, you sense the presence of an orc nearby that responds to
your mental control.  You find you can issue the following commands
to your orc unit:

   ADMIT, ATTACK, BANNER, BEHIND, CONTACT, DEFAULT, DEFEND, DROP,
   EXECUTE, FLAG, GIVE, HOSTILE, MOVE, NAME, NEUTRAL, PILLAGE,
   PROMOTE, RAZE, SEEK, STACK, STOP, TAKE, TERRORIZE, UNSTACK, WAIT
