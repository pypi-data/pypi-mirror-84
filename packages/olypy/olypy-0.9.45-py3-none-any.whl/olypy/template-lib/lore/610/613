The engineer directs the construction of a wheeled wooden frame
containing a mechanism to supply stress to the end of a long
wooden pole.  The pole contains a basket which may be loaded
with stones or other missiles to be hurled against the enemy's
walls, or over them.  A winch to lower the pole and a release
mechanism finish the siege engine.

Catapults are sometimes loaded with the bodies of the enemy's
dead and hurled over their walls, to dishearten the besieged and
spread disease amongst them.
