#Spell:  Banish undead [9197]
#
Usage:  USE @@@@

Required aura:  number of undead in location
Time to cast:   seven days

Banish all undead from the caster's location.  Requires one aura
point for every undead to be banished.  The spell is all-or-none;
if sufficient aura is not available to banish all of the undead at
once, the spell fails, and no undead will be banished.  (No aura
is used if the spell fails, however).
