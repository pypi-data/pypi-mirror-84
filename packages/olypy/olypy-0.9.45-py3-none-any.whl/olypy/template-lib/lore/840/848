in order for scry attempts to be detected.  The skill is used
automatically whenever the mage's location is the target of an
location scry spell.

USE of the skill will cause the magician to practice scry detection.
Practice should improve the experience rating with this skill over

attempts and identifying their source.

No aura is depleted when a scry is detected.
