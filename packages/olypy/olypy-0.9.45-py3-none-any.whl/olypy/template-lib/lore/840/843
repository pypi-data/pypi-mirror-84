#Spell:  Shroud location from magical scry [9142]
#
Usage:  USE @@@@ [aura]

Required aura:  one or more points, as given
Required item:
Time to cast:   three days

Creates a magical shroud over the mage's current province.  The
shroud hinders attempts by distant mages to view the location by
magical scrying.

The shroud is invested with twice the aura used in its creation.
A mage attempting to view the location from a distance with a
scry spell must expend a greater amount of aura than the shroud
possesses to succeed.

The shroud loses one point of aura at the end of each month.
Successive uses of @@@@ are additive.  For example, USE @@@@ 1
followed by USE @@@@ 3 will result in a location shroud with an
aura of eight points.

The default aura to use is one point.
