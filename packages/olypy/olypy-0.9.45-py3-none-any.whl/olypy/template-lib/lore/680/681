The engineer directs three workers to build a wooden tower,
covered with treated leather skins or iron plating to protect
the tower from burning.  The tower contains several ladders
and a platform from which soldiers may attack.

In battle, the tower is wheeled up against an enemy's walls
and used by attacking soldiers to match the height of the
defenders.  The attackers may then climb from the tower onto
the walls.
