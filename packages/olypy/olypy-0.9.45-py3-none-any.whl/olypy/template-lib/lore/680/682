#Skill:  Quarry building stone [9566]
#
Usage:     QUARRY [number of stones] [days]
Requires:  at least one worker

Building stone is used in the construction of temples, castles and
towers.  Up to 50 stone may be removed from mountain provinces or
rocky hills each month, or up to ten stone from desert provinces.

Each worker will cut and prepare one building stone [78] per day.

Examples:

    quarry         # cut as much building stone as possible
    quarry 25      # stop after cutting 25 stone
    quarry 0 5     # quarry stone for five days
    quarry 25 5    # stop after five days, or 25 stone, whichever
                   # comes first

In all cases, quarrying will cease as soon as the supply of ready stone
in the province has been exhausted.
