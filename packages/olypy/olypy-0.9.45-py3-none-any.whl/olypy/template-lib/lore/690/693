The alchemist performs a delicate operation to extract the
highly poisonous ratspider venom.

The top of the ratspider's head is removed by inserting a sharp
knife above the head joint and twisting.  Two glands, from which
the ratspider venom is later extracted, are removed from behind
the mandible.

Risk is minimized by taking extreme care when handling the
ratspider.  The ratspider is killed in the process.
