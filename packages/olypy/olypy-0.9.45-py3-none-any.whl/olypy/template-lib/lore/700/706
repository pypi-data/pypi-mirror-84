#Skill:  Harvest opium [9588]
#
Usage:    OPIUM [number] [days]
Time:     as given or necessary

Poppy fields produce 25 harvestable opium [93] each month.
A noble using the OPIUM command will collect one unit of opium
each day.

Examples:

    opium          # obtain as much opium as possible
    opium 25       # stop after getting 25 opium
    opium 0 5      # harvest opium for five days
    opium 25 5     # stop after five days, or 25 opium, whichever
                   # comes first

In all cases, opium harvesting will cease as soon as the field's supply
for the month has been exhausted.

OPIUM is an alias for COLLECT 93.
