#Spell:  Hinder meditation [9175]
#
Usage:  USE @@@@ <target> [aura]

Required aura:  one to three points, as given
Time to cast:   ten days

Clouds the target's mind with disturbing images and incoherent
thoughts.  The target mage will have difficulty achieving the
proper mental state during his next attempt at meditation.

The next meditate spell issued by the target may fail, resulting
in the mage not acquiring a point of current aura. The more aura
invested in @@@@, the greater the chance the target mage will fail:

	aura	chance of failure
	----	-----------------
	 1	      10%
	 2	      25%
	 3	      50%
	 4	      75%
	 5	      90%

Hinder meditation [@@@@] directed against mages using Advanced
Meditiation [813] will cause them to only gain half of the
normal aura obtained.

If the target does not meditate, the spell will lose one point
of aura at the end of each month until it has dissipated.  Casts
by multiple mages accumulate on the target, although the spell may
not accumulate more than five points of aura.

For example, if two mages each cast USE @@@@ 501 3, character [501]
will have a 90% chance of failure in his next attempt to meditate.
(One aura point has been wasted, since only five may accumulate on
the target).  At the end of the month, the strength of the @@@@
spell against [501] will diminish to four points, and [501] will
have a 75% chance of failure during his next meditation.

A mage may cast multiple @@@@ spells; they accumulate on the targets,
not on the casting magician.

@@@@ has no effect on non-magicians.

The default amount of aura is one point.
