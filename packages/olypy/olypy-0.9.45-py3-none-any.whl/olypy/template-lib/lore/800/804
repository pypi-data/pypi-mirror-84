#Spell:  View current aura level of others [9105]
#
Usage:  USE @@@@ [aura]

Required aura:  one or more points, as given
Required item:
Time to cast:   seven days

The specified aura will be invested to learn the current aura
levels of other mages in the location.  The default amount of
aura to use is one point.

The current aura level of other mages present in the same location as
the caster will be shown, unless they are shrouding their abilities.
If a mage is employing an ability shroud, the aura invested in USE @@@@
must exceed the shroud's aura, or that mage's current aura level won't
be shown.

For instance, USE @@@@ 1 will show the current aura for mages that are
not shrouding their abilities.  USE @@@@ 3 will show the current aura
for all mages except those shrouding their abilities with three or more
points of aura.
