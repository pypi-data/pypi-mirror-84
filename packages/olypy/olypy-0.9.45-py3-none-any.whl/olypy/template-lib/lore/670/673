#Skill:  Raise peasant mob [9537]

Usage:  RAISE
Time:   seven days

The noble gives an impassioned speech, rousing peasants and causing
them to gather into a crowd.  New peasant crowds will set their GUARD
flag to protect their homes from pillaging.

Peasant mobs may be formed in provinces and cities.  Only one crowd
may be raised per location.  Only when the raised mob is later killed,
or if the peasants return to their homes, may another mob be raised
there.
