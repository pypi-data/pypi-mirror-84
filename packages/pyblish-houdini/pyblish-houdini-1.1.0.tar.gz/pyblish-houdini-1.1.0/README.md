[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pyblish/pyblish-houdini.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pyblish/pyblish-houdini)

Pyblish integration for SideFx Houdini 8-18.5.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### What is included?

A set of common plug-ins and functions shared across other integrations - such as getting the current working file. It also visually integrates Pyblish into the File-menu for easy access.

- Common [plug-ins](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-houdini/tree/master/pyblish_houdini/plugins)
- Common [functionality](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-houdini/blob/master/pyblish_houdini/__init__.py)
- File-menu shortcut

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Installation

pyblish-houdini depends on [pyblish-base](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-base) and is available via PyPI.

```bash
$ pip install pyblish-houdini
```

You may also want to consider a graphical user interface, such as [pyblish-qml](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-qml) or [pyblish-lite](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-lite).

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Usage

To get started using pyblish-houdini, run `setup()` at startup of your application.

```python
# 1. Register your favourite GUI
import pyblish.api
pyblish.api.register_gui("pyblish_lite")

# 2. Set-up Pyblish for Houdini
import pyblish_houdini
pyblish_houdini.setup()
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Persistence

In order to have Pyblish become a permanent member of each Houdini session, you can add the supplied `houdini_path/` folder to your `HOUDINI_PATH` environment variable.

Take care however, for this variable has an unexpected quirk on Windows platforms.

```bash
$ set "HOUDINI_PATH=C:\pythonpath\pyblish_houdini\houdini_path;&"
```

Note the `&` sign, and the fact that the entire expression is wrapped in quotation marks.

If you use batch script files on Windows to launch Houdini, you'll need to escape the "&" character with "^&".

With this variable set, you should find a new File-menu item.

**NOTE: If you use "HOUDINI_PATH" in houdini.env, make sure you setup the path here instead or inherit the environment with "$HOUDINI_PATH"**

- [Teardown pyblish-houdini](#teardown-pyblish-houdini)
- [No GUI](#no-gui)

<br>
<br>
<br>

##### Under the hood

The `setup()` command will:

1. Register Houdini related ["hosts"](http://api.pyblish.com/pages/Plugin.hosts.html), allowing plug-ins to be filtered accordingly.
3. Register a minimal set of plug-ins that are common across all integrations.

<br>
<br>
<br>

##### Manually show GUI

The menu-button is set to run `show()`, which you may also manually call yourself, such as from a shelf-button.

```python
import pyblish_houdini
pyblish_houdini.show()
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

##### Teardown pyblish-houdini

To get rid of the menu, and completely remove any trace of pyblish-houdini from your Houdini session, run `teardown()`.

```python
import pyblish_houdini
pyblish_houdini.teardown()
```

This will do the opposite of `setup()` and clean things up for you.

<br>
<br>
<br>

##### No GUI

In the event that no GUI is registered upon running `setup()`, the button will provide the *user* with this information on how they can get up and running on their own.
