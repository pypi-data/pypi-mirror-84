    """Factory for class with self-keeping SSH or local connection.

    Main purpose is to have SSH connection with convenience methods which can
    be easily used. Connection is resiliet to errors and will reinitialize
    itself if for some reason it fails. It also has a local wariant which is
    mirroring its API but uses os and shutil and subprocess modules internally.

    This is a factory class so calling any of the initializer classmethods
    returns initialized SSHConnection or LocalConnection based on arguments.

    All methods belong to class so this object should not be instantiated.

    Upon import this class automatically reads ssh configuration file in:
    ~/.ssh/config if it is present. The class is then indexable by keys in
    config file so calling:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from ssh_utilities import Connection
    >>> Connection[<server_name>]
    >>> <ssh_utilities.ssh_utils.SSHConnection at 0x7efedff4fb38>

    There is also a specific get method which is safer and with better typing
    support than dict-like indexing

    >>> from ssh_utilities import Connection
    >>> Connection.get(<server_name>)
    >>> <ssh_utilities.ssh_utils.SSHConnection at 0x7efedff4fb38>

    Class can be also used as a context manager.

    >>> from ssh_utilities import Connection
    >>> with Connection(<server_name>) as conn:
    >>>     conn.something(...)

    Connection can also be initialized from appropriately formated string.
    Strings are used mainly for underlying connection classes persistance to
    disk

    >>> from ssh_utilities import Connection
    >>> conn = Connection.from_str(<string>)

    returns an initialized connection instance.

    All these return connection with preset reasonable parameters if more
    customization is required, use open method, this also allows use of
    passwords

    >>> from ssh_utilities import Connection
    >>> conn = Connection.open(<ssh_username>, <ssh_server>, <ssh_key_file>,
