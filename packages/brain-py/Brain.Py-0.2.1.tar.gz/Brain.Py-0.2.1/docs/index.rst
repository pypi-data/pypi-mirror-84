BrainPy documentation
========================

``BrainPy`` is a lightweight framework for neuronal dynamics simulation
purely based on **native** python. It only relies on `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_.
However, if you want to get faster performance,you can additionally
install `Numba <http://numba.pydata.org/>`_. With `Numba`, the speed of C or FORTRAN can
be obtained in the simulation.


.. note::

    BrainPy is a project under development.
    More features are coming soon. Contributions are welcome.
