# diffractem

Pre-processing software for serial electron diffraction data.
See https://doi.org/10.1101/682575 for usage example.

Note that this is still in a _very_ early stage. 
A critical dependency is CrystFEL, available from http://www.desy.de/~twhite/crystfel/.

It can be installed from python package index by: `pip install diffractem`
