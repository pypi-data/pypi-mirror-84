Description: # Py-AVL-Tree
        A python package to make a Tree's like a Binary Tree and Balanced AVL Tree.
        
        # How to install?
        
        Use:
        
        ```
        pip install Py-AVL-Tree
        ```
        
        
        # How to use?
        
        First, import the AVL class.
        
        ```python
        from TreeAVL.AVL import AVL
        ```
        
        Now, you have to parse a list with nodes to create a object tree.
        
        ```python
        from TreeAVL.AVL import AVL
        
        tree = AVL([10, 5, 15, 7, 18, 9])
        ```
        
        To show your binary tree, just parse your new object tree to print.
        
        ```python
        from TreeAVL.AVL import AVL
        
        tree = AVL([10, 5, 15, 7, 18, 9])
        print(tree)
        ```
        
        If you have to balance your tree, just call the method BalanceTree()
        
        ```python
        from TreeAVL.AVL import AVL
        
        tree = AVL([10, 5, 15, 7, 18, 9])
        print(tree)
        tree.BalanceTree()
        print(tree)
        ```
