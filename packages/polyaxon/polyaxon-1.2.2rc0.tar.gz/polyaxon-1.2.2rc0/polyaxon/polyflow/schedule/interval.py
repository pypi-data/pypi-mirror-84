        end_at: datetime, optional
        frequency: int, required

    ## YAML usage

    ```yaml
    >>> schedule:
    >>>   kind:
    >>>   startAt:
    >>>   endAt:
    >>>   frequency:
    >>>   dependsOnPast:
    ```

    ## Python usage

    ```python
    >>> from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    >>> from polyaxon.polyflow import V1IntervalSchedule
    >>> schedule = V1IntervalSchedule(
    >>>   start_at=datetime(...),
    >>>   end_at=datetime(...),
    >>>   frequency=timedelta(...),
    >>>   dependsOnPast=False,
    >>> )
    ```

    ## Fields

    ### kind

    The kind signals to the CLI, client, and other tools that this schedule is an interval schedule.

    If you are using the python client to create the schedule,
    this field is not required and is set by default.

    ```yaml
    >>> run:
    >>>   kind: interval
    ```

    ### startAt

    Optional field to set the start time for kicking the first execution,
    all following executions will be relative to this time.

    ```yaml
    >>> run:
    >>>   startAt: "2019-06-24T21:20:07+00:00"
    ```

    ### endAt

    Optional field to set the end time for stopping this schedule.

    ```yaml
    >>> run:
    >>>   endAt: "2019-06-24T21:20:07+00:00"
    ```

    ### frequency

    The time delta value for setting the frequency of triggering executions.

    When using the python client you can pass `datetime.TimeDelta`
    where you can set human interpretable precision, e.g. `days`,
    and in the yaml specification you can only pass seconds.

    ```yaml
    >>> run:
    >>>   frequency: 120
    ```

    ### dependsOnPast

    Optional field to tell Polyaxon to check if the
    previous execution was done before scheduling a new one, by default this is set to `false`.

    ```yaml
    >>> run:
    >>>   dependsOnPast: true
    ```
