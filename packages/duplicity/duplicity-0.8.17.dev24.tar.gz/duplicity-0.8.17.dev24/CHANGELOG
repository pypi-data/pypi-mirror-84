New in v0.8.16 (2020/09/29)
---------------------------
* Revert "Merge branch 's3-boto3-region-and-endpoint' into 'master'"
  - It broke existing setups since defaults were not supplied.
* Merged in convert2md - Convert README's to markdown
* Merged in s3-boto3-region-and-endpoint - after fixes.
* Merged in lazy init for Boto3 network connections
* Merged in OutlawPlz:paramiko-progress
* Merged in s3-unfreeze-all


New in v0.8.15 (2020/07/27)
---------------------------
* Fix bug #1887689 with patch from Matthew Barry
  - Cleanup with Paramiko backend does not remove files due to missing
    filename byte decoding
* Fix bug #1211481 with merge from Raffaele Di Campli
  - Ignores the uid/gid from the archive and keeps the current user's one.
  - Recommended for restoring data to mounted filesystem which do not
    support Unix ownership or when root privileges are not available.
* Fix issue #10 - ppa:duplicity-release-git fails to install on Focal Fossa
  - Set correct version requirements in debian/control.
* Merged in joshAppdev:pydriveshared - Backend for Shared Drives on Google
  - pydrive://developer.gserviceaccount.com/target-folder/?driveID=<SHARED DRIVE ID>
* Merged in martin-sucha:pydrive-notfound - Fix missing FileNotUploadedError in pydrive
  - Since dadbe2d2, FileNotUploadedError is not imported anymore, resulting in an
    exception in case some of the files failed to upload. Adding the import back.
* Merged in hupfdule:s3-boto3-region-and-endpoint - Allow setting s3 region and endpoint
  - This commit introduces the new commandline options --s3-region-name, --s3-endpoint-url
    to specify these parameters. This allows using s3 compatible providers like Scaleway
    or OVH.
  - It is probably useful for Amazon accounts, too, to have more fine grained influence
    on the region to use.


New in v0.8.14 (2020/07/04)
---------------------------
* Fixes for rclonebackend from Francesco Magno (original author)
  - copy command has been replaced with copyto, that is a specialized
    version for single file operation. Performance-wise, we don't have
    to include a single file in the local side directory, and we don't
    have to list all the files in the remote to check what to syncronize.
    Additionally, we don't have to mess up with renaming because the
    copy command didn't support changing filename during transfer
    (because was oriented to transfer whole directories).
  - delete command has been replaced with deletefile. Same here, we
    have a specialized command for single file operation. Much more efficient.
  - ls command has been replaced with lsf, that is a specialized version
    that returns only filenames. Since duplicity needs only those, less
    bytes to transfer, and less parsing to do.
  - lastly, I have reintroduced a custom subprocess function because the one
    inherithed from base class is checked, and throws an exception in case of
    non zero return code. The ls command family returns a non zero value if
    the directory does not exist in the remote, so starting a new backup
    in a non existent directory is impossible at the moment because ls fails
    repeatedly until duplicity gives up. This is a bug in the current implementation.
    There is the same problem (but less severe) in _get method, using the default
    self.subprocess_popen a non zero return code will throw an exception before we
    can cleanup the partially downloaded file, if any.
* Fixed bug #1875937 - validate_encryption_settings() fails w/S3 glacier
  - Skip validation with a warning if S3 glacier or deep storage specified
* Patched in a megav2backend.py to update to MEGAcmd tools.
  - Author: Jose L. Domingo Lopez <github@24x7linux.com>
  - Man pages, docs, etc. were included.
* More fixes for bug #1877885 - Catch quota overflow on Mega upload.
* Merged in jmakovicka:master - Support PyDrive2 library in the pydrive backend
  - Unlike PyDrive, the PyDrive2 fork is actively maintained.
* Merged in mikix:mikix/rename-fix - Fix --rename encoding
  - The --rename argument wasn't working because its arguments were coming in and
    being saved as unicode. But then compared against bytestring index path parts.
  - This MR fixes that by saving the rename pieces as bytestrings up front.
* Fixes for issue #7, par2backend produces badly encoded filenames.
* Set deprecation version to 0.9.0 for short filenames.


New in v0.8.13 (2020/05/05)
---------------------------
* Fixed bug #1868414 - timeout parameter not passed to
  BlobService for Azure backend
* Merged in lp:~kenneth-loafman/duplicity/duplicity-pylint
  - Enable additional pylint warnings. Make 1st pass at correction.
      unused-argument,
      unused-wildcard-import,
      redefined-builtin,
      bad-indentation,
      mixed-indentation,
     unreachable
  - Renamed globals to config to fix conflict with __builtin__.globals()

* Fixed bug #1876446 - WebDAV backend creates only tiny or 0 Byte files


New in v0.8.12 (2020/03/19)
---------------------------
* Fixed bug #1865648 - module 'multiprocessing.dummy' has
  no attribute 'cpu_count'.
  - replaced with module psutil for cpu_count() only
  - appears Arch Linux does not support multiprocessing
* Fixed a couple of file history bugs:
  - #1044715 Provide a file history feature
    + removed neutering done between series
  - #1526557 --file-changed does not work
    + fixed str/bytes issue finding filename
* Fixed bug #1755955 - best order is unclear,
  of exclude-if-present and exclude-device-files
  - Removed warning and will now allow these two to
    be in any order.  If encountered outside of the
    first two slots, duplicity will silently move
    them to be in the first two slots.  Within those
    two slots the order does not matter.
* Fixed bug #1769267 - [enhancement] please consider
  using rclone as backend.
* Cleaned up some setup issues where the man pages
  and snapcraft.yaml were not getting versioned.
* Fixed bug #1867435 - TypeError: must be str,
  not bytes using PCA backend

  codec can't decode byte 0x85 in position 0:
  ordinal not in range(128) with PCA
* Fixed bug #1867742 - TypeError: fsdecode()
  takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
  with PCA backend
* Merged in translation updates


New in v0.8.11 (2020/02/24)
---------------------------
* Gave up fighting the fascist version control
  munging on snapcraft.io.  Duplicity now has the
  form 0.8.10.1558, where the last number is the
  bzr revno.  Can't do something nice like having
  a dev/fin indicator like 0.8.10dev1558 for dev
  versions and a fin for release or final.
* Enhance setup.py/cfg to allow install by pip.
* Adjust Dockerfiles to new requirements.
* Fixed bug #1861287 - Removing old backup chains
  fails using pexpect+sftp
* Reworked setup.py to build a pip-compatible
  distribution tarball of duplicity.
* Added dist/makepip for convenience.
* Renamed botobackend.py to s3_boto_backend.py
* Fixed bug #1860405 - Auth mechanism not supported
  - Added python3-boto3 requirement to snapcraft.yaml
* Fixed bug #1862672 - test_log does not respect TMPDIR

  - Removed --extra-clean, code, and docs
* Add rclone requirement to snapcraft.yaml
* Fixed bug #1863018 - mediafire backend fails on py3
  - Fixed handling of bytes filename in url.
* Fixed bug #1857818 - startswith first arg must be bytes
  - use util.fsdecode on filename
* Fixed to work around par2 0.8.1 core dump on short name
  - https://github.com/Parchive/par2cmdline/issues/145
* Merged in translation updates


New in v0.8.10 (2020/01/23)
---------------------------
* Switched to python3 for snaps.
* Fixed bug #1858713 - paramiko socket.timeout
  - chan.recv() can return bytes or str based on
    the phase of the moon.  Make allowances.
* Removed some unneeded includes of gettext
* Fixed bug #1859304 with patch from Arduous
  - Backup and restore do not work on SCP backend
* Move to single-sourceing the package version
  - Rework setup.py, dist/makedist, dist/makesnap,
    etc., to get version from duplicity/__init__.py
  - Drop dist/relfiles.  It was problematic.
* Fixed bug #1859877 - syntax warning on python 3.8
* Skip functional/test_selection::TestUnicode if
  python version is less than 3.7.
* Clean up some TODO tasks in testing code.
* Clean up deprecation errors in Python 3.8
* Fixed bug #1858204 - ENODEV should be added to
  list of recognized error stringa
* Fixed bug #1858207 missing targets in multibackend
  - Made it possible to return default value instead
    of taking a fatal exception on an operation by
    operation approach.  The only use case now is for
    multibackend to be able to list all targets and
    report back on the ones that don't work.
* Merged in translation updates


New in v0.8.09 (2020/01/07)
---------------------------
* Fixed bug #1855636 with patch from Filip Slunecko
  - Wrong buf type returned on error.  Make bytes.
* Fixed bug #1855736 with help from Michael Terry
  - Decode Popen output to utf8
* Fixed bug #1856447 with hint from Enno L
  - Replaced with formatted string
* Fixed bug #1855736 - duplicity fails to start
  - Made imports absolute in dup_main.py
* Fixed a mess I made.  setup.py was shebanged to
  Py3, duplicity was shebanged to Py2.  This meant
  that duplicity ran as Py2 but could not find its
  modules because they were under Py3.  AArgh!
* Renamed testing/infrastructure to testing/docker
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/boto.fixup
  - fix manpage indention
  - clarify difference between boto backends
  - add boto+s3:// for future use when boto3+s3://
    will become default s3 backend
* Fixed bug #1857554 name 'file' is not defined
  - file() calls replaced by open() in 3 places.
* Convert all shebangs to python3 for bug #1855736

* Fixed bug #1858153 with patch from az
  - mega backend: fails to create directory
* Add snapcraft login to makesnap
* Fixed bug #1858295 - Unicode error in source filename
  - decode arg if it comes in as bytes
* Fixed bug #1855736 again - Duplicity fails to start
  - remove decode from unicode string
* Merged in translation updates


New in v0.8.08 (2019/12/08)
---------------------------
* Fixed bug #1852848 with patch from Tomas Krizek
  - B2 moved the API from "b2" package into a separate "b2sdk" package.
    Using the old "b2" package is now deprecated. See link:
    https://github.com/Backblaze/B2_Command_Line_Tool/blob/master/b2/_sdk_deprecation.py
  - b2backend.py currently depends on both "b2" and "b2sdk", but use of "b2"
    is enforced and "b2sdk" isn't used at all.
  - The attached patch uses "b2sdk" as the primary dependency. If the new
    "b2sdk" module isn't available, it falls back to using the old "b2" in
    order to keep backward compatibility with older installations.
* Added build signing to dist/makesnap.
* Fixed bug #1852876 '_io.BufferedReader' object has no attribute 'uc_name'
  - Fixed a couple of instances where str() was used in place of util.uexc()
  - The file was opened with builtins, so use name, not uc_name
* Fixed bug #1851668 with help from Wolfgang Rohdewald
  - Applied patches to handle translations.
* Fixed bug #1853655 - duplicity crashes with --exclude-older-than
  - The exclusion setup checked for valid string only.  Made
    the code comprehend datetime (int) as well.
* Fixed bug #1853809 - Tests failing with Python 3.8 / Deprecation warnings
  - Fixed the deprecation warnings with patch from Sebastien Bacher
  - Fixed test_globmatch to handle python 3.8 same as 3.7
  - Fixed tox.ini to include python 3.8 in future tests
* Merged in lp:~carlalex/duplicity/duplicity
  - Fixes bug #1840044: Migrate boto backend to boto3
  - New module uses boto3+s3:// as schema.
* Fixed bug #1855379 with patch from Daniel González Gasull
  - Issue warning on temporary connection loss.
* Fixed bug #1854554 with help from Tommy Nguyen
  - Fixed a typo made during Python 3 conversion.
* Merged in translation updates


New in v0.8.07 (2019/11/14)
---------------------------
* Added b2sdk to snapcraft.yaml
* Fixed bug #1850440 with suggestion from Paolo Montrasio
  - TypeError: Can't mix strings and bytes in path components
* Fixed bug #1850990 with suggestion from Jon Wilson
  - --s3-use-glacier and --no-encryption cause slow backups
* Added dist/makesnap to make spaps automagically.
* Fixed bug #1851167 with help from Aspen Barnes
  - Had Popen() to return strings not bytes
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/pydrive-cache-fix
  - The pydrive backend had another of the ongoing bytes/string issues. :)
  - This time, it was saving a bytes filename in its internal cache after
    each volume upload. Then when asked for a list of files later, it
    would add the byte-filenames from its cache to the results.
    And we'd end up thinking there were two of the same filename on the backend,
    which would cause a crash at the end of an otherwise successful backup,
    because the collections code would assert on the filenames being unique.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/resume-encrypt-no-pass
  - This branch arose from a Debian patch that has been disabling the
    encryption validation of volume1 during restarts for years.
  - Debian has been preserving the ability to back up with just an encrypt
    key and no password (i.e. to have no secrets on the backup machine).
* Fixed bug #1851727 - InvalidBackendURL for multi backend
  - Encode to utf8 only on Python2, otherwise leave as unicode
* Merged in translation updates


New in v0.8.06 (2019/11/05)
---------------------------
* Removed a setting in tox.ini that causes coverage to
  be activated during testing duplicity.
* Fixed Resouce warnings when using paramiko.  It turns out
  that duplicity's ssh_paramiko_backend.py was not handling
  warning suppression and ended up clearing all warnings,
  including those that default to off.
* Updated b2 backend to work with both v0 and v1 of b2sdk
* Fixed bug #1847885 - B2 fails on string concatenation.
  - use util.fsdecode() to get a string not bytes.
  - Partially fixed in bug #1843995, this applies same fix to
    remaining instances of the problem
* Fixed bug #1848203 with patch from Michael Apozyan
  - convert to integer division
* Fixed bug #1626061 with patch from Michael Apozyan
  - While doing multipart upload to s3 we need to report the
    total size of uploaded data, and not the size of each part
    individually.  So we need to keep track of all parts
    uploaded so far and sum it up on the fly.
* Fixed bug #1848783 with patch from Jacob Middag
  - Don't use byte strings in regex
* Fixed bug #1848166 - Swift backend fails on string concat
  - added util.fsdecode() where needed
* Fixed bug #1849661 with patch from Graham Cobb
  - The problem is that b2backend uses 'quote_plus' on the
    destination URL without specifying the 'safe' argument as
    '/'. Note that 'quote' defaults 'safe' to '/', but
    'quote_plus' does not!
* Added additional fsdecode's to uses of local_path.name and
  source_path.name in b2backend's _get() and _put.  See bug
  #1847885 for more details.
* Removed a couple of disables from pylint code test.
  - E1103 - Maybe has no member
  - E0712 - Catching an exception which doesn't inherit from BaseException
* Revisited bug #1848783 - par2+webdav raises TypeError on Python 3
  - Fixed so bytes filenames were compared as unicode in re.match()
* Removed file() call in swiftbackend.  It's been deprecated since py2.
* Updated snapcraft.yaml to include rdiffdir and did some reformatting.
* Updated snapcraft.yaml to remove rdiffdir and add libatm1 to stage.
* Updated snapcraft.yaml to remove python-lockfile and fix spelling.
* Merged in translation updates


New in v0.8.05 (2019/10/06)
---------------------------
* Changed dist/makedist to fall back to dist/relfiles.txt
  in case bzr or git is not available to get files list.
  Tox sdist needs setup.py which needs dist/makedist.
* Updatated LINGUAS file to add four new translations.
* Set to allow pydevd usage during tox testing.
* Adjust exclusion list for rsync into duplicity_test.
* Fix exc.args handling.  Sometimes it's (message, int),
  other times its (int, message).  We look for the
  message and use that for the exception report.
* Added more python future includes to support using
  python3 code mixed with python2.
* Sort of Fixed bugs #1836887 and #1836888 by skipping the
  tests under question when running on ppc64el machines.
* Fix MacOS tempfile selection to avoid /tmp and /var/tmp.  See:
  https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/duplicity-talk/2019-09/msg00000.html
* Add testenv:coverage and took it out of defaults.  Some cleanup.
* Clean up some pylint warnings.
* Fixed bug #1843995 - B2 fails on string concatenation.
  - use util.fsdecode() to get a string not bytes.
* Fixed bug #1844750 - RsyncBackend fails if used with multi-backend.
  - used patch provided by KDM to fix.
* Fixed bug reported on maillist - Python error in Webdav backend.  See:
  https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/duplicity-talk/2019-09/msg00026.html
* Fixed bug #1846167 - webdavbackend.py: expected bytes-like object, not str
  - base64 now returns bytes where it used to be strings, so just decode().
* Fixed bug #1844950 - ssh-pexpect backend syntax error
  - put the global before the import.
* Fixed bug #1846678 - --exclude-device-files and -other-filesystems crashes
  - assuming all options had arguments was fixed.
* Merged in translation updates


New in v0.8.04 (2019/08/31)
---------------------------
* Fixed bug #1839728 with info from Avleen Vig
  - b2 backend requires additional import
* Fixed bug #1839886 with hint from denick
  - Duplicity crashes when using --file-prefix
* Removed socket.settimeout from backend.py.
  It was already set in commandline.py.
* Removed pycryptopp from README requirements
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/08-snap-python2
  - Add packaging code for Snapcraft/Snap packages
* Fixed build on Launchpad for 0.8.x, so now there is a new PPA at
  https://launchpad.net/~duplicity-team/+archive/ubuntu/daily-dev-trunk
* Ran futurize selectively filter-by-filter to find the ones that work.
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/08-README-TESTING
  - Change README-TESTING to be correct for running individual tests
    now that we have moved to Tox/Pytest.
* Merged in lp:~kaffeekiffer/duplicity/azure-filename
  - Encode Azure back-end paths
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/08-docker-local-import
  - Convert the Docker infrastructure to pull the local branch into
    duplicity_test. This allows testing the local branch with the
    known-good Docker environment, even if it has not yet been
    committed to trunk.
  - As a consequence, remove the -r option to build-duplicity_test.sh.
    This functionality can be achieved by branching that revision
    before running the script.
* Made some changes to the Docker infrastructure:
  - All scripts run from any directory, assuming directory
    structure remains the same.
  - Changed from Docker's COPY internal command which is slow to
    using external rsync which is faster and allows excludes.
  - Removed a couple of unused files.
* Merged in translation updates


New in v0.8.03 (2019/08/09)
---------------------------
* Some changes to provide Python test coverage:
  - Coverage runs with every test cycle
  - Does not cover functional tests that spawn
    duplicity itself.  Next pass.
  - After a run use 'coverage report html' to see
    an overview list and links to drill down.  It
    shows up in htmlcov/index.html.
* Fixed bugs #1838427 and #1838702 with a fix
  suggested by Stephen Miller.  The fix was to
  supply tarfile with a unicode grpid, not bytes.
* More changes to provide Python test coverage:
  - Now covers functional tests spawning duplicity
  - Does not cover bin/duplicity for some reason
* More changes to provide Python test coverage:
  - Moved bulk of code from bin/duplicity to
    duplicity/dup_main.py for coverage.
* Fixed some 2to3 issues in dup_main.py
* Fixed division differences with futurize
* Merged in translation updates

  new bzr revisions if changed since last build.
* Enhanced build_duplicity_test.sh
  - Use -h to get help and defaults
  - Takes arguments for distro, revno, help

  - The return type of util.uexc should always be a string.
* Fix some import conflicts with the "past" module
  - Rename collections.py to dup_collections.py
  - Remove all "from future.utils import old_div"
  - Replace old_div() with "//" (in py27 for a while).
  - All tests run for py3, unit tests run for py2.  The new
    import fail is "from future import standard_library"
* Fixed bug #1831178 sequence item 0: expected str instance, int found
  - Simply converted int to str when making list
* Merged in lp:~kaffeekiffer/duplicity/azure-python3-fix
  - Use util.fsencode to encode file string
* Fixed bug #1833573 0.8.00 does not work on Python 2
  - Fixed shebang to use /usr/bin/python instead of python
* Fixed bug #1833559 0.8 test fails with 'duplicity not found' errors
  - Fixed assumption that duplicity/rdiffdir were in $PATH

  - Someone is messing with regex.  Fix same.
  - See https://bugs.python.org/issue29995 for details
* Normalize shebang to just python, no version number
* Fix so most testing/*.py files have the future suggested lines
  - from __future__ import print_function
    from future import standard_library
    standard_library.install_aliases()
* Merged lp:~mterry/duplicity/boto-import
  - A couple functions in the boto backend were using the boto module
    without importing it first.
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/08-dockerfixes
  - Update duplicity_test Dockerfile:
    * Use 18.04 instead of 16.04

  - allow symlink to have optional trailing slash during verify.
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/07-fix_deja_dup_error_on_locked_files
  - Revert log.Error to log.Warn, as it was prior to the merge in rev 1224,
    as this was affecting other applications (e.g. deja dup; Bug #1605939).
* Merged in lp:~mwilck/duplicity/duplicity
  - Speedup of path_matches_glob() by about 8x.  See
    https://code.launchpad.net/~mwilck/duplicity/duplicity/+merge/301268
    for more details.

  - Backblaze announced a new domain for the b2 api
* Fixed bug #1623342 with patch from Daniel Jakots
  - failing test on OpenBSD because tar/gtar not found
* Merged in lp:~mwilck/duplicity/duplicity
  - GPG: enable truly non-interactive operation with gpg2
  - This patch fixes the IMO unexpected behavior that, when using GnuPG2, a pass phrase dialog always pops up for
    saving backups. This is particularly annoying when trying to do unattended / fully automatic backups.
* Fixed bug #1621194 with code from Tornhoof
  - Do backup to google drive working without a service account
* Merged in lp:~havard/duplicity/jottacloudbackend
  - Adds support for a new backend, jottacloud.com, using the scheme `jottacloud:/<folder>`.
  - Reverse-engineered library, `jottalib`: http://github.com/havardgulldahl/jottalib
  - Here's how you set up jottalib https://github.com/havardgulldahl/jottalib/wiki
* Merged in lp:~breunigs/duplicity/amazondrive
  - Provide a native backend for AmazonDrive
* Merged in lp:~breunigs/duplicity/amazondrive2
  - Fixed variable renaming issue
* Fixed bug #1642098 - does not create PAR2 archives when '--par2-options' is used
  - Missing space between par2-options plus default options
* Fixed bug using 40-char sign keys, from Richard McGraw on mail list
  - Remove truncation of argument and adjust comments
* Merged in lp:~dernils/duplicity/robust-dropbox-backend
  - Added new command line option --backend-retry-delay
    that allows to determine the time that duplicity sleeps
    before retrying after an error has occured.
  - Added some robustness to dpbxbackend.py that ensures re-authentication
    happens in case that a socket is changed (e.g. due to a forced reconnect
    of a dynamic internet connection).
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/manpage.fixes
  - Fix html output via rman on the website
* Merged in lp:~horgh/duplicity/copy-symlink-targets-721599
  - Add --copy-links to copy symlink contents, not just the link itself.
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/Bug_1624725_files_within_folder_slash
  - Fixed Bug #1624725, so that an include glob ending in "/" now includes folder contents (for globs with
    and without special characters). This preserves the behaviour that an expression ending in "/" only
    matches a folder, but now the contents of any matching folder is included.
* Fix some issues with testing on MacOS
* Fix problem with gpg2 in yakety and zesty
* Fixed bug #1642813 with patch from Ravi
  - If stat() returns None, don't attempt to set perms.
* Merged in lp:~breunigs/duplicity/amazondrive3
  - As reported on the mailinglist, if a space is entered while duplicity asks for the URL, it fails.
    Since all important spaces are URL encoded anyway, this should be fine even if there are spaces in
    the URL at all. I also patched it in the onedrive backend, because it must have similar issues.
* Fixed bug #1623342 with patch supplied by Daniel Jakots
  - Failing test on OpenBSD because tar/gtar not found
* Fixed bug #1654220 with patch supplied by Kenneth Newwood
  - Duplicity fails on MacOS because GPG version parsing fails

    duplicity's --exclude-if-present option.
  - Move and rename TestTrailingSlash2 test (was duplicate name) as in 0.7-series.
  - Fix PEP error on adbackend.py.
  - Add jottalib as a tox dep to fix pylint error.
  - Remove unnecessary skipUnless Linux as per 0.7-series.
* Fixed bug #1655268 "--gpg-binary option not working"
  - If gpg binary is specified rebuild gpg profile using new binary location
* Merged in lp:~matthew-t-bentley/duplicity/duplicity
  - Sets a user agent. Backblaze asked for this in case there are errors that originate
    from the Duplicity B2 backend
  - Only retrieves a new upload URL when the current one expires, to bring it in line
    with their best practices for integrations: https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/integration_checklist.html
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/08-merge-glob-parsers
  - Use a single code path for glob strings whether or not these contain special
    characters/wildcards (glob_get_normal_sf) and remove glob_get_filename_sf and glob_get_tuple_sf.
  - Remove run-tests-ve as this was identical to run-tests.
* Add detail about import exceptions in onedrivebackend.py
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/08-refactor-unit-test-globmatch
  - Rename path_matches_glob_fn to select_fn_from_glob, as this more accurately reflects the return value.
  - Significantly refactored unit/test_globmatch.py to make this cleaner and clearer.
* Fixed bug #1657916 with patch supplied by Daniel Harvey
  - B2 provider cannot handle two backups in the same bucket
* Fixed bug #1603704 with patch supplied by Maciej Bliziński
  - Crash with UnicodeEncodeError
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/08-python-futurize-stage-1
  - Made many of the safer changes for improved Python 3 support (python-future's futurize -stage1)
    without functional change to the code (and leaving the isinstance(s, types.StringType) tests unchanged).
  - Created Python 2/3 compatible tests for int and long.
  - Update setup.py to show only Python 2.7 support.
* Merged in lp:~marix/duplicity/azure-storage-0.30.0-plus
  - This makes the Azure backend compatible with version 0.30.0 and up of the
    underlying azure-storage package.
* Merged in lp:~marix/duplicity/azure-storage-sas
  - This branch adds support for Shared Access Signature to the Azure backend
    which allows to run Duplicity with a minimal set of permissions.
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/pep8_test_fixes
  - Fix PEP-8 testing by moving to using pycodestyle library.
  - Temporarily add ignores to allow these tests to pass.
  - Fix E305 PEP8 errors: expected 2 blank lines after class or function definition, found 1.
* Merged in lp:~benoit.bertholon/duplicity/duplicity
  - Fixes bug #1666194 - ProcessCommandLine function called twice fail and arglist argument not used
* Fixed variable name change in last merge which broke a bunch of tests
  - Changed archive_dir_root back to archive_dir
* Fixed bug #1367675 - IMAP Backend does not work with Yahoo server
  - added the split() as needed in 'nums=list[0].strip().split(" ")'
  - the other fixes mentioned in the bug report comments were already done
* Merged in lp:~benoit.bertholon/duplicity/duplicity
  - Use the globals.archive_dir variable to store only a string
    in the case of a path, uses globals.archive_dir_path
* Merged in p:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/pep8_E402_fixes
  - Fixed PEP8 errors: E402 module level import not at top of file
* Fixed bug #1671852 - Code regression caused by revision 1108
  - change util.uexc() back to bare uexc()
* Fixed bug #1668750 - Don't mask backend errors
  - added exception prints to module import errors
* Fixed bug #1680682 with patch supplied from Dave Allan
  - Only specify --pinentry-mode=loopback when --use-agent is not specified
* Fixed man page that had 'cancel' instead of 'loopback' for pinentry mode
* Fixed bug #1684312 with suggestion from Wade Rossman
  - Use shutil.copyfile instead of os.system('cp ...')
  - Should reduce overhead of os.system() memory usage.
* Merged in lp:~dernils/duplicity/testing
  - Fixed minor stuff in requirements.txt.
  - Added a Dockerfile for testing.
  - Minor changes to README files.
  - Added README-TESTING with some information on testing.
* Merged in lp:~dernils/duplicity/documentation
  - Minor changes to README-REPO, README-TESTING
  - Also redo the changes to requirements.txt and Dockerfile
* Merged in lp:~dawgfoto/duplicity/replicate
  - Add replicate command to replicate a backup (or backup
    sets older than a given time) to another backend, leveraging
    duplicity's backend and compression/encryption infrastructure.
* Fixed some incoming PyLint and PEP-8 errors.
* Merged in lp:~marix/duplicity/add-azure-arguments
  - Using the Azure backend to store large amounts of data we found that
    performance is sub-optimal. The changes on this branch add command line
    parameters to fine-tune some parameters of the Azure storage library,
    allowing to push write performance towards Azure above 1 Gb/s for large
    back-ups. If a user does not provide the parameters the defaults of the
    Azure storage library will continue to be used.
* Replace incoming non-ASCII chars in commandline.py
* bzr does not honor perms so fix the perms at the start of the testing and
  avoid annoying error regarding testing/gnupg having too lenient perms
* Merged in lp:~dernils/duplicity/DockerfileConvenience
  - Added a few tools to the Dockerfile that make life easier
* Fixed bug #1320832 with suggestion from Oskar Wycislak
  - Use chunks instead of reading it all in swiftbackend
* Merged in lp:~dernils/duplicity/DockerfileConvenience
  - Add a few files that are the beginning of further infrastructure based
    on docker. It contains a Dockerfile for a simple ftp server (used for
    backend testing) and a setup script that can be used to set up the
    complete test environment.
* Moved Dockerfile for duplicitytest into testinfrastructure/duplicity_test
* Moved some things around in testing/infrastructure to clean up
* Fixed bug #1689632 with patch from Howard Kaye
  - On MacOS, the tempfile.TemporaryFile call erroneously raises an
    IOError exception saying that too many files are open. This causes
    restores to fail randomly, after thousands of files have been restored.
* Fixed bug #1320641 and others regarding lockfile
  - swap from lockfile to fasteners module
  - use an fcntl() style lock for process lock of duplicity cache
  - lockfile will now clear if duplicity is killed or crashes
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/tox_pylint_fixes
  - Changes needed to run-tests without pylint E0401(import-error) errors
* Merged in lp:~xlucas/duplicity/swift-storage-policies
  - This brings support for Swift storage policies: when using a Swift
    backend, you can specify the policy containers should be operating on.
  - This is similar to AWS Cloud Storage classes (ia, rrs, glacier and so on).
* Merged in lp:~dernils/duplicity/Dockerfile
  - Added another backend to the docker test infrastructure, updated the setup
    for testing and updated the documentation.
* Merged in lp:~dernils/duplicity/Dockerfile
  - Now have subnet name and IP of the subnet for testing as a variable.
* May have finally fixed bug #1556553, "Too many open files...".
  - Applied patch from Howard Kaye, question #631423.  The fix is to dup
    the file descriptor, and then close the file in the deallocator
    routine in the glue code. Duping the file lets the C code and the Python
    code each close the file when they are done with it.
  - Invalidated and removed the fix put in for bug #1320832.
  - Caveat: long incremental chains will still eat up a large number of file
    descriptors.  It's a very risky practice, so I'm not inclined to fix it.
* Revisited bug #670891 with patch from Edgar Soldin
  - Forced librsync.PatchedFile() to extract file object from TemporaryFile()
    object when on Windows or Cygwin systems.  This allows us to avoid the
    problem of tmpfile() use which creates temp files in the wrong place.
  - See discussion at https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/670891
* Fixed bug #1672540 with patch from Benoit Nadeau
  - Rename would fail to move par files when moving across filesystems.
  - Patch uses shutil.move() to do the rename instead.
* Merged in lp:~dernils/duplicity/docker-compose
  - Test Infrastructure now utilizing docker-compose
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/08-fix-man-verify
  - Fix description of --verify and --compare-data in the man page. Now
    clarifies that verify compares the restored files to hashes stored at
    backup date, while --compare-data compares restored files to files
    in target_path.
* Fixed bug #1265765 with patches from Matthias Larisch and Edgar Soldin
  - SSH Paramiko backend now uses BufferedFile implementation to enable
    collecting the entire list of files on the backend.
* Copy.com is gone so remove copycombackend.py.
* Merged in lp:~xlucas/duplicity/swift-multibackend-bug
  - Fix a bug when swift backend is used in a multibackend configuration.
* Fixed problem in dist/makedist when building on Mac where AppleDouble
  files were being created in the tarball.  See:
  https://superuser.com/questions/61185/why-do-i-get-files-like-foo-in-my-tarball-on-os-x
* Merged in lp:~dawgfoto/duplicity/replicate
  - Add integration test for newly added replicate command.
  - Also see https://code.launchpad.net/~dawgfoto/duplicity/replicate/+merge/322836.
* Merged in lp:~xlucas/duplicity/multibackend-prefix-affinity
  - Support prefix affinity in multibackend.
* Merged in lp:~xlucas/duplicity/pca-backend
  - Add support for OVH Public Cloud Archive backend.
* Fixed PEP8 and 2to3 issues.
* Patched in lp:~dawgfoto/duplicity/skip_sync_collection_status
  - collection-status should not sync metadata
  - up-to-date local metadata is not needed as collection-status is
    generated from remote file list
  - syncing metadata might require to download several GBs
* Fixed slowness in 'collection-status' by basing the status on the
  remote system only.  The local cache is treated as empty.
* Fixed encrypted remote manifest handling to merely put out a non-fatal
  error message and continue if the private key is not available.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/giobackend-display-name
  - giobackend: handle a wider variety of gio backends by making less assumptions;
    in particular, this fixes the google-drive: backend
* Fixed bug #1709047 with suggestion from Gary Hasson
  - fixed so default was to use original filename
* Fixed PEP8 errors in bin/duplicity
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/gio_child_for_display_name
  - gio: be slightly more correct and get child GFiles based on display name
* Fixed bug #1711905 with suggestion from Schneider
  - log.Warn was invoked with log.warn in webdavbackend.py
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/gpg-tag-versions
  - Support gpg versions numbers that have tags on them.
  - This can happen if you build gpg from git trunk (e.g. 2.1.15-beta20). Or if you run
    against the freedesktop flatpak runtime (e.g. 2.1.14-unknown).
* Fixed bug #1394386 with new module megabackend.py from Tomas Vondra
  - uses megatools from https://megatools.megous.com/ instead of mega.py library
    which has been deprecated
  - fixed copyright and PEP8 issues
  - replaced subprocess.call() with self.subprocess_popen() to standardize
* Fixed bug #1538333 Assertion error in manifest.py: assert filecount == ...
  - Made sure to never pass .part files as true manifest files
  - Changed assert to log.Error to warn about truncated/corrupt filelist
  - Added unit test to make sure detection works
  - Note: while this condition is serious, it will not affect the basic backup and restore
    functions.  Interactive options like --list-files-changed and --file-changed will not
    work correctly for this backup set, so it is advised to run a full backup as soon as
    possible after this error occurs.
* Fixed bug #1638033 Remove leading slash on --file-to-restore
  - code already used rstrip('/') so change to just strip('/')
* Fixed bug introduced in new megabackend.py where process_commandline()
  takes a string not a list.  Now it takes both.
* Updated web page for new megabackend requirements.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/more-decode-issues
  - Here's some fixes for another couple UnicodeDecodeErrors.
  - The duplicity/dup_time.py fixes when a user passes a utf8 date string (or a string with bogus
    utf8 characters, but they have to really try to do that). This is bug 1334436.
  - The bin/duplicity change from str(e) to util.uexc(e) fixes bug 1324188.
  - The rest of the changes (util.exception_traceback and bin/duplicity changes to use it) are to
    make the printing of exceptions prettier. Without this, if you see a French exception, you see
    "accept\xe9es" instead of "acceptées".
  - You can test all of these changes in one simple line:
    $ LANGUAGE=fr duplicity remove-older-than $'accept\xffées'
* Fix backend.py to allow string, list, and tuple types to support megabackend.py.
* Fixed bug #1715650 with patch from Mattheww S
  - Fix to make duplicity attempt a get first, then create, a container
    in order to support container ACLs.
* Fixed bug #1714663 "Volume signed by XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, not XXXXXXXX"
  - Normalized comparison length to min length of compared keys before comparison
  - Avoids comparing mix of short, long, or fingerprint size keys.
* Patched in lp:~mterry/duplicity/rename-dep
  - Make rename command a dependency for LP build
* Fixed bug #1654756 with new b2backend.py module from Vincent Rouille
  - Faster (big files are uploaded in chunks)
  - Added upload progress reporting support
* Fixed bug #1448094 with patch from Wolfgang Rohdewald
  - Don't log incremental deletes for chains that have no incrementals
* Fixed bug #1724144 "--gpg-options unused with some commands"
  - Add --gpg-options to get version run command
* Fixed bug #1720159 - Cannot allocate memory with large manifest file since 0.7.03
  - filelist is not read if --file-changed option in collection-status not present
  - This will keep memory usage lower in non collection-status operations
* Fixed bug #1723890 with patch from Killian Lackhove
  - Fixes error handling in pydrivebackend.py
* Fixed bug #1730902 GPG Error Handling
  - use util.ufn() not str() to handle encoding
* Fixed bug #1733057 AttributeError: 'GPGError' object has no attribute 'decode'
  - Replaced call to util.ufn() with call to util.uexc().  Stupid typo!
* More fixes for Unicode handling
  - Default to 'utf-8' if sys.getfilesystemencoding() returns 'ascii' or None
  - Fixed bug #1386373 with suggestion from Eugene Morozov
* Merged in lp:~crosser/duplicity/fix-oauth-flow
  - Fixed bug #1638236 "BackendException with oauth2client 4.0.0"
* Merged in lp:~crosser/duplicity/dpbx-fix-file-listing
  - Fixed bug #1639664 "Dropbox support needs to be updated for Dropbox SDK v7.1"
* Merged in lp:~crosser/duplicity/fix-small-file-upload
  - Fixed small file upload changes made in Dropbox SDK v7.1
* Converted to use pytest instead of unittest (setup.py test is now discouraged)
  - We use @pytest.mark.nocapture to mark the tests (gpg) that require
    no capture of file streams (currently 10 tests).
  - The rest of the tests are run normally
* More pytest changes
  - Use requirements.txt for dependencies
  - Run unit tests first, then functional
  - Some general cleanup
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/08-ufn-to-uc_name
  - Replace util.ufn(path.name) with path.uc_name throughout.
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/08-ufn-to-fsdecode
  - Change util.fsdecode to use "replace" instead of "ignore" (matching behaviour of util.ufn)
  - Replace all uses of ufn with fsdecode
  - Make backend.tobytes use util.fsencode rather than reimplementing
* Reduce dependencies on backend libraries
  - Moved backend imports into backend class __init__ method
  - Surrounded imports with try/except to allow better errors
  - Put all library dependencies in requirements.txt
* Merged in lp:~dawgfoto/duplicity/fixup1251
  - Avoid redundant replication of already present backup sets.
  - Fixed by adding back BackupSet.__eq__ which was accidentally(?) removed in 1251.
* Merged in lp:~dawgfoto/duplicity/fixup1252
  * only check decryptable remote manifests
    - fixup of revision 1252 which introduces a non-fatal error message (see #1729796)
    - for backups the GPG private key and/or it's password are typically not available
    - also avoid interactive password queries through e.g. gpg agent
* Fixed bug #1768954 with patch from Max Hallden
  - Add AZURE_ENDPOINT_SUFFIX environ variable to allow setting to non-U.S. servers
* Fixed bug #x1717935 with suggestion from strainu
  - Use urllib.quote_plus() to properly quote pathnames passed via URL
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/08-pycodestyle
  - Tox changes to accommodate new pycodestyle version warnings.
    Ignored W504 for now and marked as a TODO.
    Marked W503 as a permanent ignore, as it is prefered to the (mutually exclusive) W504 under PEP8.
  - Marked various regex strings as raw strings to avoid the new W605 "invalid escape sequence".
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/08-unadorned-strings
  - Added new script to find unadorned strings (testing/find_unadorned_strings.py python_file)
    which prints all unadorned strings in a .py file.
  - Added a new test to test_code.py that checks across all files for unadorned strings and gives
    an error if any are found (most files are in an ignore list at this stage, but this will allow
    us to incrementally remove the exceptions as we adorn the strings in each file).
  - Adorn string literals in test_code.py with u/b
* Fixed bug #1780617 Test fail when GnuPG >= 2.2.8
  - Relevant change in GnuPG 2.2.8: https://dev.gnupg.org/T3981
  - Added '--ignore-mdc-error' to all gpg calls made.
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/08-adorn-strings
  - Adorning string literals (normally to make these unicode), in support of a transition to Python 3.
    See https://blueprints.launchpad.net/duplicity/+spec/adorn-string-literals
  - Adorn string in duplicity/globmatch.py.
  - Adorn strings in testing/unit/test_globmatch.py
  - Adorn strings in selection.py
  - Adorn strings in functional/test_selection.py and unit/test_selection.py
  - Remove ignores for these files in test_code.py
* Added function to fix unadorned strings (testing/fix_unadorned_strings.py)
  - Fixes by inserting 'u' before token string
  - Solves 99.9% of the use cases we have
  - Fix unadorned strings to unicode in bin/duplicity and bin/rdiffdir
  - Add import for __future__.print_function to find_unadorned_strings.py
* Fixed unadorned strings to unicode in duplicity/backends/*
  - Some fixup due to shifting indentataion not matching PEP8.
* Reverted back to rev 1317 and reimplemented revs 1319 to 1322
* Adorned strings in testing/, testing/functional/, and testing/unit
* Added AUTHORS file listing all copyright claimants in headers
* Merged in lp:~mgorse/duplicity/0.8-series
  - Adorn some duplicity/*.py strings. I've avoided submitting anything that I think might require
    significant discussion; I think that reviewing will be easier this way. Mostly annotated strings
    as unicode, except for librsync.py.
* Merged in lp:~qsantos/duplicity/fix-unmatched-rule-error
  - There are actually two commits: the first fixes a very minor detail in the README regarding the
    Python version that should be used; the second fixes the way exceptions are handled when an
    incorrect rule is specified, and display the nice error message rather than an obscure stack trace.
* Merged in lp:~mgorse/duplicity/0.8-series
  - Adorn some remaining strings
* Merged in lp:~mgorse/duplicity/0.8-series
  - Run futurize --stage1, and adjust so that tests still pass.
* Fixed but #1797797 with patch from Bas Hulsken
  - use bytes instead of unicode for '/' in filenames
* Merged in lp:~mcuelenaere/duplicity/duplicity
  - Make sure we don't load files completely into memory when transferring them from/to
    the remote WebDAV endpoint.
* Fixed bug #1798206 and bug #1798504
  - Made paramiko a global with import during __init__ so it would
    not be loaded unless needed.
* Merged in lp:~mgorse/duplicity/0.8-series
  - First pass at a python 3 port.
* Fixed bug #1803896 with patch from slawekbunka
  - Add __enter__ and __exit__ to B2ProgressListener
* Merged in lp:~okrasz/duplicity/duplicity
  - Add --azure-blob-tier that specifies storage tier
    (Hot,Cool,Archive) used for uploaded files.
* Merged in lp:~vam9/duplicity/0.8-series-s3-kms-support
  - Added s3 kms server side encryption support with kms-grants support.
* Merged in lp:~mgorse/duplicity/0.8-series
  - More python 3 fixes
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/08-uexc-fix
  - Fix for Bug #1770929 with associated test cases (thanks to Pete Zaitcev (zaitcev)
    in Bug #1797928 for the head start).
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/08-style-fixes
  - Fix pylint style issues (over-indented text, whitespace on blank lines etc)
  - Removed "pylint: disable=bad-string-format-type" comment, which was throwing
    an error and does not seem to be needed.
* Removed last mention of copy.com from man page with help from edso.
* Fixed bug #1811114 with revised onedrivebackend.py from David Martin
  - Adapt to new Microsoft Graph API
* Merged in lp:~brandon753-ba/duplicity/aws-glacier
  - Adds support for for a command line option to store data on AWS S3 Glacier.
* Manual merge of lp:~yajo/duplicity/duplicity
  - Support partial metadata sync.
  - Fixes bug #1823858 by letting the user to choose partial syncing. Only the metadata for the target chain
    will be downloaded. If older (or newer) chains are encrypted with a different passphrase, the user will
    be able to restore to a given time by supplying only the passphrase for the chain selected by
    the `--restore-time` option when using this new option.
  - A side effect is that using this flag reduces dramatically the sync time when moving files from one to
    another location, in cases where big amounts of chains are found.

  - upload last chunk with files_upload_session_finish to avoid extra request
  - upload small files using non-chunked api
* Fixed bug #1586934 with patches from Dmitry Nezhevenko
  - fixes error handling in wrapper
* Fixed bug #1586992 with patches from Dmitry Nezhevenko

  - Added ignore_case option to selection functions
* Merged in lp:~mstoll-de/duplicity/b2-reauth
  - Fixes bug #1588503 b2: large uploads fail due to expired auth token
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/fix_pep8
  - Fix PEP8 error in onedrivebackend.py (space before bracket)
* Fixed bug #822697 ssh-options not passed in rsync over ssh
  - Added globals.ssh_options to rsync command line
* Increased default volume size to 200M, was 25M

    PEP8 test for this in test_code.CodeTest.
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/PEP8_line_length
  - Set line length error length to 120 (matching tox.ini) for PEP8 and
    fixed E501(line too long) errors.
* Merged in lp:~duplicity-team/duplicity/po-updates
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/08-unicode
  - Many strings have been changed to unicode for better handling of international
    characters and to make the transition to Python 3 significantly easier, primarily
    on the 'local' side of duplicity (selection, commandline arguments etc) rather
    than any backends etc.
* Fixes so pylint 1.8.1 does not complain about missing conditional imports.
  - Fix dpbxbackend so that imports require instantiation of the class.
  - Added pylint: disable=import-error to a couple of conditional imports

  - More changes for unicode and py3 support
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/pydrive-root
  - Just a tiny fix to clean up the temporary file we create to find the root ID.
    It's a little surprising for the user if they wind up with this file called
    "i_am_in_root" that they don't know where it came from. Almost sounds like
    they were hacked.
* Fixed bug #1817375 with hint from mgorse
  - Added 'global pexpect' at end of imports


New in v0.7.07.1 (2016/04/19)

    to allow the user to continue using the old version
* Fixed bug #1570293 duplicity is very slow due to excessive fsync
  - removed flush() after write.

---------------------------
* Merged in lp:~matthew-t-bentley/duplicity/b2
  - Fix import and error typos.
  - Allow multiple backups in the same bucket.
  - Fixes bug #1523498.
  - A couple fixes allowing multiple backups to be hosted in different
    folders in the same bucket as well as some logging for -v9.
* Random stuff:
  - remove RPM stuff from makedist
  - have makedist pull directly from VCS, not local dir
  - update po translation directory and build process
  - clean up some odd error messages
  - move Pep8 ignores to tox.ini
  - supply correct path for pydevd under Mac
  - fix some tests to run under Linux and Mac
* Partial fix for bug #1529606 - shell code injection in lftpbackend
  - still need to fix the other backends that spawn shell commands
* Make test_restart compatible with both GNUtar and BSDtar
* Fix stupid issue with functional test path for duplicity
* Applied patch from shaochun to Fixed bug #1531154,
  - --file-changed failed when file contains spaces
* Applied patch from abeverly to Fixed bug #1475890
  - allow port to be specified along with hostname on S3
  - adjusted help text and man page to reflect the change
* Undo changes to test_restart.py.  GNU tar is needed.
* Fix minor pep8 nit in collections.py
* Applied changes from ralle-ubuntu to Fixed bug 1072130.
  - duplicity does not support ftpes://

* Adjust so test_restart.py can run on Mac as well
* Fix for bug #1538333 - assert filecount == len(self.files_changed)
  - added flush after every write for all FileobjHooked files which
    should prevent some errors when duplicity is forcibly closed.
* Fixed bug #1540279 - mistake in --help
* Applied patch from kay-diam to fix error handling in ssh pexpect,
  fixes bug #1541314
* Fixed a patching error in ssh_pexpect_backend.py
* Merged in lp:~fpytloun/duplicity/webdav-gssapi-fix
  - Make kerberos optional for webdav backend
* Merged in lp:~harningt/duplicity/multibackend-mirror
  - This changeset addresses multibackend handling to permit a
    mirroring option in addition to its "stripe" mode to make it
    a redundancy tool vs space-expansion tool. To do this without
    changing the configuration too much, I used the query string
    that would generally go unused for files to specify behavior
    that applies to all items inside the configuration file.
* Added acdclibackend.py from Stefan Breunig and Malay Shah
  - renamed from amazoncloudbackend to stress use of acd_cli
* Fixed some 2to3 and Pep8 issues that had crept in
* Backed out changes made by patching for bug #1541314.  These
  patches should not have been applied to the 0.7 series.
* Merged in lp:~rye/duplicity/mediafire

    backend.py
    - make sure url path component is properly url decoded,
      in case it contains special chars (eg. @ or space)
    lftpbackend.py
    - quote _all_ cmd line params
    - added missing lftp+ftpes protocol
    - fix empty list result when chdir failed silently
    - added ssl_cacert_path support
    webdavbackend.py

      (using system certs eg. in /etc/ssl/certs)
    - added ssl_cacert_path support for python 2.7.9+
    - gettext wrapped all log messages
    - minor refinements
* Applied patch from Dmitry Nezhevenko to upgrade dropbox backend:
  - update to SDK v2
  - use chunked upload
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/improve_present_get_sf_man_page
  - Improve man page entry for --exclude-if-present
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/split_glob_matching_from_select
  - Move glob matching code out of selection.py's Select function and
    into globmatch.py.
* Fixed bug reported on the mailing list from Mark Grandi (assertion error
  while backing up).  In file_naming.parse() the filename was being lower
  cased prior to parsing.  If you had used a prefix with mixed case, we
  were writing the file properly, but could not find it in the backend.
* Merged in lp:~duplicity-team/duplicity/po-updates


New in v0.7.06 (2015/12/07)
---------------------------
* Merged in lp:~mnjul/duplicity/s3-infreq-access
  - This adds support for AWS S3's newly announced Infrequent Access
    storage class and is intended to implement Blueprint:
    https://blueprints.launchpad.net/duplicity/+spec/aws-s3-std-ia-class .
  - A new command line option, --s3-use-ia, is added, and boto backend
    will automatically use the correct storage class value depending on
    whether --s3-use-rrs and --s3-use-ia is set. Command line parser will
    prompt error if both --s3-use-ia and --s3-use-rrs are used together,
    as they conflict with each other.
  - The manpage has been updated giving a short explanation on the new
    option. Its wording derives from Amazon's official announcement:
    https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2015/09/announcing-new-\
    amazon-s3-storage-class-and-lower-glacier-prices/
* The ptyprocess module no longer supports Python 2.6, so fix tox.ini to
  use an older version.  Make explicit environs for all tests.
* Upgrade to newest version of pep8 and pylint.   Add three ignores
  to test_pep8 and one to test_pylint to get the rest to pass.  They
* Applied patch from Alexander Zangerl to update to changes in lockfile
  API 0.9 and later.  Updated README to notify users.
* Modded tox.ini to use the latest lockfile.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/setup.shebang
  - Having the python interpreter searched in the PATH is much more
    flexible than the /usr/bin/python inserted into our scripts shebang
    by setuptools.  This patch prevents that. don't touch my shebang! :)
* Cleanup issues around Launchpad build, mainly lockfile >= 0.9.
* Merged in lp:~michal-s/duplicity/duplicity
  - WindowsAzureMissingResourceError and WindowsAzureConflictError
    changed due to SDK changes.
  are all valid in our case.
* Reversed previous changes to lockfile.  Now it will take any version
  extant in the LP build repository.  (PyPi is not avail in LP build).
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/tempfile.tempdir
  - make sure packages using python's tempfile create temp files in
    duplicity's temp dir
* Fixed bug #1511308 - Cannot restore no-encryption, no-compression backup
  - Corrected code to include plain file in write_multivolume()
  - Added PlainWriteFile() to gpg.py
* Merged in lp:~michal-s/duplicity/duplicity
  - Fix azurebackend storage class import
* Merged in lp:~feraudet/duplicity/fix
  - Fix missing SWIFT_ENDPOINT_TYPE env var, bug 1519694.
* Fixed bug #1520691 - Shell Code Injection in hsi backend
  - Replace use of os.popen3() with subprocess equivalent.
  - Added code to expand relative program path to full path.
  - Fix hisbackend where it expected a list not a string.
* Merged in lp:~noizyland/duplicity/azurebackend-fixes
  - Support new version of Azure Storage SDK
  - Refactor _list method to support containers with >5000 blobs
* Merged in lp:~matthew-t-bentley/duplicity/b2
  - Adds a backed for BackBlaze's (currently beta) B2 backup service.
  - This adds backends/b2backend.py, modifies log.py to add an
    error code and modifies commandline.py to add the b2://
    example to the help text.
* Pep8 corrections for recently released code.
* Fixed bug #1260666 universally by splitting the filelist for
  delete before passing to backend.
* Fixed bug #1369243 by adjusting messages to be more readable.
* Fixed bug #1375019 with patch from Eric Bavier (home to tmp).
* Fixed bug #1379575 with patch from Tim Ruffing (shorten webdav response).
* Fixed bug #1492301 with patch from askretov (manually refresh oauth).


New in v0.7.05 (2015/09/15)
---------------------------
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/fix_patch_error
  - Change use of mock.patch in unit tests to accommodate the obsolete
    version of python-mock on the build server.
* Fixed Bug 1476019 S3 storage bucket not being automatically created
  with patch from abeverley
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/launchpad_tox_profile
  - Add tox testing profile that mimics the packages installed on the
    Launchpad build server, to reduce the likelihood of tests passing
    our test suite, but failing on the build server (e.g. because of
    the out-of-date mock version).
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/disable_code_tests_for_lpbuildd
  - Set RUN_CODE_TESTS to 0 for lpbuildd tox profile, reflecting its value
    on the Launchpad build server (and therefore skipping PEP8, 2to3 and
    pylint). More accurately reflects the system we are mimicking and saves
    approximately 1 minute per test run.
* Fixed Bug 1438170 duplicity crashes on resume when using gpg-agent with
  patch from Artur Bodera (abodera).  Applied the same patch to incremental
  resumes as well.
* Merged in lp:~w.baranowski/duplicity/selection_debug
  - This little patch logs debug messages concerning path selection process,
    and so allows users to debug their include/exclude configuration.
* Merged in lp:~germar/duplicity/par2removefix
  - After reorganisation in revision 981 and the fix for bug #1406173 the
    par2backend does not remove .par2 files anymore when removing
    duplicity-*.gpg files.
  - This banch adds an unfiltered_list() method which is used in
    delete() and delete_list()
* Updated man pages to reflect more contributors.
* Fixed bug #1493573.  Correct option typo in man page.
* Fixed bug #1494228 CygWin: TypeError: basis_file must be a (true) file
  - The problem that caused the change to tempfile.TemporaryFile was due
    to the fact that os.tmpfile always creates its file in the system
    temp directory, not in the directory specified.  The fix applied was
    to use os.tmpfile in cygwin/windows and tempfile.TemporaryFile in all
    the rest.  This means that cygwin is now broken with respect to temp
    file placement of this one file (deleted automatically on close).
* Merged in lp:~bmerry/duplicity/pydrive-id-cache
  - This fixes the issue a number of users (including myself) have been
    having with duplicity creating files with duplicate filenames on
    Google Drive. It keeps a runtime cache of filename to object ID
    mappings, so that once it has uploaded an object it won't be fooled
    by weakly consistent directory listings.
* Merged in lp:~duplicity-team/duplicity/po-updates


New in v0.7.04 (2015/08/02)
---------------------------
* Merged in lp:~noizyland/duplicity/fix-progress
  - Fixes bug 1264744.  selection.filelist_globbing_get_sfs leaves the
    filelist file object's position at the end of the file. When the
    --progress option is used the filelists need to be read twice. On
    the second read nothing is read from the file because file has
    already been read and the position is EOF.  This patch calls seek(0)
    on the filelist to reset the position to BOF so that subsequent
    read() calls will return data.
* Added pylint ignore error in webdavbackend.py.
* Merged in lp:~bmerry/duplicity/pydrive-regular
  - This implements the proposal made by somebody else
    (http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/duplicity-talk/2015-02/msg00037.html)
    to allow the pydrive backend to work with a normal drive account instead
    of a service account. It seems to be working for me: I was able to migrate
    seamlessly from the gdocs backend. It's set up so that a service account
    can still be used, depending on which environment variable is set.
    The man page is updated to describe how to use the new functionality.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/gdocs.pydrive
  - make pydrive new gdocs default backend
  - keep gdata backend as gdata+gdocs://
* Merged in lp:~raymii/duplicity/fix-swiftbackend-max-10000-files-in-list
  - Swiftclient by default returns at max 10000 files. By adding
    full_listing=True we make sure all objects are returned.
    Ref: https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/duplicity-talk/2015-05/msg00060.html
    and http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-swiftclient/swiftclient.html#swiftclient.client.get_container
* Fix a couple of PEP8 glitches.
* Fixed bug 791794 - description of --gpg-options is misleading, Simply
  needed to add the '--' before the options as in "--opt1 --opt2=parm".
* Fixed bug 1465335 - pydrive still use files in trash can - with patch
  from Kuang-che Wu to ignore trashed files.
* Fixed bug 1452263 - par2 option not working on small processors - with patch
  from Kuang-che Wu to ignore default 30 second timeout.
* Fixed bug 1466160 - pydrive backend is slow to remove old backup set - with
  patch from Kuang-che Wu to implement _delete_list().
* Fixed bug 1466582 - reduce unnecessary syscall with --exclude-if-present - with
  patch from Kuang-che Wu to make sure resulting path is a directory.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/gpg.binary
  - new parameter --gpg-binary allows user to point to a different gpg binary,
    not necessarily in path
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/gpg.binary
  - new parameter --gpg-binary allows user to point to a different gpg binary,
    not necessarily in path
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/fix_POTFILES.in_and_run-tests
  - Fixed two filename references in po/POTFILES.in, a mistake which crept in in
    rev 1093 and caused testing/run-tests to fail with "IndexError: list index
    out of range".
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/reactivate_progress_test
  - Re-enable the test of the --progress option (test_exclude_filelist_progress_option),
    which was marked as an expected failure. The issue causing this test to fail was
    fixed in revision 1095 and the test now passes.
* Fixed bug 1471348 Multi back-end doesn't work with hubiC
  - added init of appropriate superclass in both cases.
* Fixed bug 1471348 Multi back-end doesn't work with hubiC (again)
  - hubiC should reach up to duplicity.backend.__init__
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/bug_884371
  - Fixed Bug #884371 - Stopped an exclude glob trumping an earlier scan glob, but also
    ensured that an exclude glob is not trumped by a later include. This fix is important,
    as without it files that are specified to be included are not being backed up as expected.
  - Fixed Bug #932482 - a trailing slash at the end of globs no longer prevents them working
    as expected.
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/reenable_tests
  - Re-enable unit.test_selection tests that had been temporarily commented out.
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/trailing_slash_match_dirs
  - Made globs with trailing slashes only match directories, not files, fixing Bug #1479545.
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/improve_tox_and_python-6_testing
  - Testing improvements, particularly in relation to testing against Python version 2.6:
    * tox.ini fixed so that it is possible to run individual tests against both Python 2.6 and 2.7;
    * updated test_code.py to use unittest2 for Python versions < 2.7 (instead of failing);
    * ./run-tests now correctly runs all tests against both Python 2.6 and 2.7; and
    * improved testing directions in README-REPO.
* Merged in lp:~dag-stenstad/duplicity/swift_authversion_3_support
  - Added support for Openstack Identity v3 in the Swift backend.
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/fix_2to3_issues
  - Fixed 2to3 issues. Updated README-REPO with more test information. Updated pylint and
    test_diff2 descriptions to make it clear these require packages to be installed on the
    sytem to pass. All tests pass on Python 2.6 and Python 2.7 as at this revision.


New in v0.7.03 (2015/05/11)
---------------------------
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/filelist_combine
  - Merged globbing and non-globbing filelists to use the same code path
    and all accept globbing characters. Added deprecation warning to the
    --exclude-globbing-filelist and include-globbing-filelist options in
    commandline.py and hid them from help output. Updated the manual
    (and unit tests) accordingly.
  - Note that this does trigger a change in behaviour for duplicity.
    Previously, include patterns in include-filelist did not match files
    in a directory that was included, so /usr/local in an include file
    would not have matched /usr/local/doc. Now, this folder would be
    included, as would occur if --include or the old
    --include-globbing-filelist was used. Additional lines will therefore
    need to be added to filelists to unambiguously exclude unwanted
    subfolders, if this is intended.
  - Mark --include-filelist-stdin and --exclude-fielist-stdin for
    deprecation and hide from --help output.
* Fixed bug 1432999 with hint from Antoine Afalo.
  - '/'s at end of destination cause problems with onedrivebackend.
* Fixed bug 1434702 with help from Robin Nehls
  - incorrect response BackendException while downloading signatures file.
* Fixed bug 1437789 with patch from pdf
  - par2backend.py incorrect syntax in get()
* Merge in lp:~stynor/duplicity/multi-backend
  - A new backend that allows use of more than one backend stores (e.g. to
    combine the available space from more than one cloud provider to make
    a larger store available to duplicity).
* Move requirements section lower in manpage.
* Merge in lp:~cemsbr/duplicity/duplicity
  - Fixed bug 1432229 in Copy.com backend:
    Reply header has no content-type for JSON detection. Now, we also check
    whether the content starts with '{'.
* Fixed bug 1444404 with patch from Samu Nuutamo
  - rdiffdir patch crashes if a regular file is changed to a non-regular
    file (symlink, fifo, ...)
* Fixed bug 1448249 and bug 1449151 thanks to David Coppit.
  - When patching, close base file before renaming
  - Enable --ignore-errors flag in rdiffdir
* Added ability to get single file status from collection-status with
  patch from jitao (bug 1044715), like so:
  $ duplicity collection-status --file-changed c1 file://./foo
* Merge in lp:~sjakthol/duplicity/onedrive-error-message
  - Add proper error message for OneDrive backend when python-requests or
    python-requests-oauthlib is not installed (bug 1453355).


New in v0.7.02 (2015/03/10)
---------------------------
* Merged in lp:~vincegt/duplicity/swift_regionname
  - Fixes bug #1376628
  - Add mapping of SWIFT_REGIONNAME to select region inside SWIFT when a
    provider proposes more than one region.
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/progress_option_error
  - Added test_exclude_globbing_filelist_progress_option into
    functional/test_selection.py, which shows the error reported in
    Bug #1264744 - that the --exclude-globbing-filelist does not backup
    the correct files if the --progress option is used. Test is marked as
    an expected failure so as not to cause the test suite to fail.
* Merged in lp:~noizyland/duplicity/fix_azurebackend_container_names
  - Azure Backend examples have underscores in the container names.  These
    are not valid Azure container names.  The underscores have been replaced
    with hypens and a note about valid container names added to the man page.
  - Also corrects a problem where Azure Exceptions were returing unicode
    strings that were not being handled correctly.
* Merged in lp:~user3942934/duplicity/pydrive
  - Currently duplicity uses gdocs backend for Google Drive backups.
    gdocs uses deprecated API and don't allow backups for managed Google
    accounts.  (see https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1315684)
  - Added pydrive backend that solves both of those problems. Published
    also on https://github.com/westerngateguard/duplicity-pydrive-backend.
* Fixed some tabs/spaces problems that were causing install failures.
* Fixed variable typo in commandline.py that was causing build fails.
* Merged in lp:~duplicity-team/duplicity/po-updates
* Remove 'gs' and 's3+http' from uses_netloc[].  Fixes Bug 1411803.
* Fixed bug # 1414418
  - Aligned commandline.py options and help display contents.
  - Aligned commandline.py options and manpage contents.
* Changed --s3_multipart_max_timeout to --s3-multipart-max-timeout to be
  consistent with commandline option naming conventions.
* Applied patch from Adam Reichold to Fixed bug # 1413792.
* Merged in lp:~angusgr/duplicity/exclude-older-than
  - Add "--exclude-older-than" commandline option, that allows you to only
    back up files with a modification date newer than a particular threshold.
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/bug_884371_asterisks_in_includes
  - Added tests to unit/test_selection.py and funtional/test_selection.py
    to show the behaviour reported in Bug #884371, i.e. that selection is
    incorrect when there is a * or ** on an include line of a filelist or
    commandline --include.
* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/bug_932482_trailing_slashes_and_wildcards_error
  - Added functional and unit tests to show Bug #932482 - that selection does
    not work correctly when excludes (in a filelist or in a commandline option)
    contain both a single or double asterisk and a trailing slash.
* Misc fixes for the following PEP8 issues:
  - E111, E121, E122, E124, E125, E126, E127, E128, E201, E202, E203,
    E231, E241, E251, E261, E262, E271, E272, E301, E302, E303, E401,
    E502, E701, E702, E703, E711, E721, W291, W292, W293, W391
  - to run pep8 on duplicity use 'pep8 --ignore=E501'
  - see http://pep8.readthedocs.org
* Fixes for 2to3 issues
* Fix spelling error in manpage, bug 1419314.
* Fix _librsyncmodule.c compilation, bug 1416344, thanks to Kari Hautio.
* Really Fixed bug 1416344 based on comment #5 by Roman Tereshonkov.
* Fix for --pydevd debug environment and location under Eclipse.
* Fix for bug where scp was actually working as scp and not working with
  rsync.net because of using extraneous test command in restricted shell.
  Was trying "test -d 'foo' || mkdir -p 'foo'", now only "mkdir -p foo".
* remove extraneous string format arg in previous scp fix.


New in v0.7.01 (2015/01/11)
---------------------------
Enhancements:
* Undid move of testing/test_code.py.  Instead I fixed it
  so that it would not run during PPA build.  It now needs
  the setting RUN_CODE_TESTS=1 in the environment which is
  supplied in the tox.ini file.
* Moved testing/test_code.py to testing/manual/code_test.py
  so PPA builds would succeed.  Should be moved back later.
* Remove valid_extension() check from file_naming.py.  It was
  causing failed tests for short filenames.  Thanks edso.
* Partial fix for PPA build failures, new backend name.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/fix.dpbx.import
  - fix dpbx import error import lazily
* Merged in lp:~hooloovoo/duplicity/fix-typo-in-test-description
  - Fixed spelling mistake/typo in a description of a test.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/missing-unicode-escape
  - Convert restore_dir to unicode before printing.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/lftp.ncftp.and.prefixes
  - retire --ssh-backend, --use-scp parameters
  - introduce scheme prefixes for alternative backend selection
    e.g. ncftp+ftp://, see manpage
  - scp is now selected via scheme e.g. scp://
  - added lftp fish, webdav(s), sftp support
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/code-nits
  - Fix some pylint/pep8 nits that prevented the test_code.py test from passing.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/debian-dir
  - Add a debian/ directory to make it easier to manage the PPAs for duplicity.
* In webdavbackend.py:
  - Fixed bug 1396106 with change by Tim Ruffing, mispelled member.
  - Added missing 'self.' before member in error message.
* Merged in lp:~adrien-delhorme/duplicity/hubic
  - Add Hubic support through pyrax and a custom pyrax_identity module.
* Fixed bug 1385599 with changes by Yannick Molin. SSL settings are now
  conditioned on protocol ftp or ftps.
* Partial fix of bug 1236248 with changes by az, manpage warning about
  --extra-clean, however, recovery with missing sig files is broken.
* Fixed bug 1255453 with changes by Gaudenz Steinlin, report backend import
  results, both normal and failed, at INFO log level.
* Manually merged in lp:~m4ktub/duplicity/0.6-reliability
  - Per fix proposed in Bug #1395341.
* Modded .bzrignore to ignore *.egg test dependencies, normalized, sorted.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/paramiko.identyfile
  - fix identity file parsing of --ssh-options for paramiko
  - manpage fixes
* Source formatted, using PyDev, all source files to fix some easily fixed
  PEP8 issues. Use ignore space when comparing against previous versions.
* Merge in lp:~andol/duplicity/signkeyformat
  - Allow --sign-key to use short format, long format alt. full fingerprint.
* Merge in lp:~hooloovoo/duplicity/verify-not-check-source
  - Tests to validate that duplicity does not check filesystem source during
    verify unless --compare-data is specified
* Merge in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/move_netloc
  - move netloc usage definitions into respective backends
  - fix "[Question #259173]: rsync backend fails"
    https://answers.launchpad.net/duplicity/+question/259173
* Make ssh an unsupported backend scheme
* Temporarily disable RsyncBackendTest and test_verify_changed_source_file
* Merge in lp:~hooloovoo/duplicity/test-verify-improvements
  - Fix up test_verify, which was a bit of a mess:
  - Simplify test_verify.py to just do a simple backup and verify on a
    single file in each test.
  - Modify tests to correctly use --compare-data option.
  - Add tests for when the source files have atime/mtime manipulated.
* Fix duplicity verify to ignore the file system when globals.compare_data is
  False.  This means that verify only validates the viability of the backup
  itself unless --compare-data is specified.
* Reenable test_verify_changed_source_file test
* Merged in lp:~hooloovoo/duplicity/add-additional-verify-tests-for-corrupted-archives
  - Add tests to test_verify.py to test that verify fails if the archive
    file is corrupted. Changed file objects to use the with keyword to ensure
    that the file is properly closed.
  - Small edit to find statement in verify_test.sh to make it work as
    expected (enclose string in quotes).
* Merged in lp:~hooloovoo/duplicity/add-else-to-badupload-try-except
  - Badupload test previously did not have an else in the try-except. The
    test passed if the except was triggered, but would also pass if the
    test did not trigger an error at all.
* Fixed bug 1406173 by applying patch supplied in report
  - Ignore .par2 files in remote file list
* Removed redundant shell test testing/verify_test.sh
* Misc fixes for the following PEP8 issues:
   - E211, E221, E222, E225, E226, E228
   - see http://pep8.readthedocs.org
* Fixed bug 1278529 by applying patch supplied in report
  - Use get_bucket() rather than lookup() on S3 to get proper error msg.
* Merged in lp:~stapelberg+ubuntu/duplicity/add-onedrive-backend
  - Add a Microsoft OneDrive backend
* Merged in lp:~hooloovoo/duplicity/filelist_select_bug_1408411
  - Adds functional test cases that fail because of Bug #1408411 (commented
    out), to assist in fixing that bug.
* Merged in lp:~hooloovoo/duplicity/process_filelists_for_spaces_etc
  - Process filelists to remove imperfections such as blank lines, comments
    and leading/trailing whitespace. Also correctly processes quoted folders
    containing spaces in their names. Extensive unit and functional tests to
    test these changes (and selection more generally).
  - The branch does add an additional folder to testfiles.tar.gz called
    select2. This included a folder with a trailing space, to test the quote
    test. The subfolders also have clearer names than in the "select" folder
    (eg "1sub2sub3") which makes it easier to keep track of issues in tests.
* Merged in lp:~9-sa/duplicity/FixBug1408289
  - Fixed bug #1408289
  - Wrong attribute name prevented raise of client exception, working now
* Merged in lp:~noizyland/duplicity/azurebackend
  - Add backend for Azure Blob Storage Service


New in v0.7.00 (2014/10/23)
---------------------------
Enhancements:
* Adjust unit tests to expect single FTP backend
* Merged in lp:~moritzm/duplicity/duplicity
  - Use lftp for both FTP and FTPS
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/0.7-dpbx.importfix
  - fix this showstopper with the dropbox backend
    "NameError: global name 'rest' is not defined"
* Merged in lp:~jflaker/duplicity/BugFix1325215
  - The reference to "--progress_rate" in the man page as a parameter is
    incorrect. Should be "--progress-rate".
* Merged in lp:~hooloovoo/duplicity/updated-README-REPO
  - Changes to README-REPO to reflect the restructuring of the directories.
* Fixed bug 1375304 with patch supplied by Aleksandar Ivanovic
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/webdav200fix-0.7
  - webdav backend fix "BackendException: Bad status code 200 reason OK. " when
    restarting an interrupted backup and overwriting partially uploaded volumes.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/require-2.6
  - Require at least Python 2.6.
  - Our code base already requires 2.6, because 2.6-isms have crept in. Usually
    because we or a contributor didn't think to test with 2.4. And frankly,
    I'm not even sure how to test with 2.4 on a modern system.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/drop-pexpect
  - Drop our local copy of pexpect in favor of a system version.
  - It's only used by the pexpect ssh backend (and if you're opting into that,
    you probably can expect that you will need pexpect) and the tests.
  - I've done a quick smoketest (backed up and restored using
    --ssh-backend=pexpect) and it seemed to work fine with a modern version
    of pexpect.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/2.6isms
  - Here's a whole stack of minor syntax modernizations that will become
    necessary in python3. They all work in python.6.
  - I've added a new test to keep us honest and prevent backsliding on these
    modernizations. It runs 2to3 and will fail the test if 2to3 finds anything
    that needs fixing (with a specific set of exceptions carved out).
  - This branch has most of the easy 2to3 fixes, the ones with obvious and
    safe syntax changes.
  - We could just let 2to3 do them for us, but ideally we use 2to3 as little
    as possible, since it doesn't always know how to solve a given problem.
    I will propose a branch later that actually does use 2to3 to generate
    python3 versions of duplicity if they are requested. But this is a first
    step to clean up the code base.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/drop-static
  - Drop static.py.
  - This is some of the oldest code in duplicity! A bzr blame says it is
    unmodified (except for whitespace / comment changes) since revision 1.
  - But it's not needed anymore. Not really even since we updated to python.4,
    which introduced the @staticmethod decorator. So this branch drops it and
    its test file.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/py3-map-filter
  - In py3, map and filter return iterable objects, not lists. So in each case
    we use them, I've either imported the future version or switched to a list
    comprehension if we really wanted a list.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/backend-unification
  - Reorganize and simplify backend code.  Specifically:
    - Formalize the expected API between backends and duplicity.  See the new
      file duplicity/backends/README for the instructions I've given authors.
    - Add some tests for our backend wrapper class as well as some tests for
      individual backends.  For several backends that have some commands do all
      the heavy lifting (hsi, tahoe, ftp), I've added fake little mock commands
      so that we can test them locally.  This doesn't truly test our integration
      with those commands, but at least lets us test the backend glue code.
    - Removed a lot of duplicate and unused code which backends were using (or
      not using).  This branch drops 700 lines of code (~20%)
      in duplicity/backends!
    - Simplified expectations of backends.  Our wrapper code now does all the
      retrying, and all the exception handling.  Backends can 'fire and forget'
      trusting our wrappers to give the user a reasonable error message.
      Obviously, backends can also add more details and make nicer error
      messages.  But they don't *have* to.
    - Separate out the backend classes from our wrapper class.  Now there is no
      possibility of namespace collision.  All our API methods use one
      underscore.  Anything else (zero or two underscores) are for the backend
      class's use.
    - Added the concept of a 'backend prefix' which is used by par2 and gio
      backends to provide generic support for "schema+" in urls -- like par2+
      or gio+.  I've since marked the '--gio' flag as deprecated, in favor of
      'gio+'.  Now you can even nest such backends like
      par2+gio+file://blah/blah.
    - The switch to control which cloudfiles backend had a typo.  I fixed this,
      but I'm not sure I should have?  If we haven't had complaints, maybe we
      can just drop the old backend.
    - I manually tested all the backends we have (except hsi and tahoe -- but
      those are simple wrappers around commands and I did test those via mocks
      per above).  I also added a bunch more manual backend tests to
      ./testing/manual/backendtest.py, which can now be run like the above to
      test all the files you have configured in config.py or you can pass it a
      URL which it will use for testing (useful for backend authors).
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/py2.6.0
  - Support python 2.6.0.
  - Without this branch, we only support python >= 2.6.5 because that's when
    python's urlparse.py module became its more modern incarnation. (I won't
    get into the wisdom of them making such a change in the middle of the
    2.6 lifecycle.)
  - Also, the version of lockfile that I have (0.8) doesn't work with python
    2.6.0 or 2.6.1 due to their implementation of
    threading.current_thread().ident returning None unexpectedly. So this
    branch tells lockfile not to worry about adding the current thread's
    identifier to the lock filename (we don't need a separate lock per thread,
    since our locking is per process).
  - I've tested with 2.6.0 and 2.7.6 (both extremes of our current support).
* Update shebang line to python instead of python to avoid confusion.
* Merged in lp:~3v1n0/duplicity/copy.com-backend
  - I've added a backend for Copy.com cloud storage, this supports all the
    required operations and works as it should from my tests.
  - You can use it by calling duplicity with something like:
    copy://account@email.com:your-password@copy.com/duplicity
  - The only thing I've concerns with is the optimized support for _delete_list
    which can't be enabled here because the test_delete_list tries also to
    delete a not-existing files, and it requires the backend not to raise an
    exception in that case (is this somewhat wanted or could we do the same as
    for _delete or _query?)
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/webdav200fix-0.7
  - webdav backend fix "BackendException: Bad status code 200 reason OK. " when
    restarting an interrupted backup and overwriting partially uploaded volumes.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/webdav-fixes
  - This branch fixes two issues I saw when testing the webdav backend:
  - 1) Errors like the following: "Attempt 1 failed. BackendException: File
    /tmp/duplicity-LQ1a0i-tempdir/mktemp-u2aiyX-2 not found locally after get
    from backend".  These were caused by the _get() method not calling setdata()
    on the local path object, so the rest of the code thought it didn't exist.
  - 2) Some odd issues from stale responses/data. We have a couple places in
    webdavbackend.py where we close the connection before making a request
    because of this problem. But I've changed it to do it every time, more
    reliably, by putting a _close() call inside the request() method.
  - With this, the webdav backend seems fine to me.
* Merged in lp:~antmak/duplicity/0.7-par2-fix
  - Useful fix for verbatim par2cmdline options (like "-t" in par2-tbb version)
* Fixed bug 1327550: OverflowError: signed integer is greater than maximum
  - Major and minor device numbers are supposed to be one byte each.  Someone
    has crafted a special system image using OpenVZ where the major and minor
    device numbers are much larger (ploop devices).  We treat them as (0,0).
* Added sxbacked.py, Skylable backend.  Waiting on man page updates.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/manpage.verify
  - Clarify verify's functionality as wished for by a user surprised with a big
    bandwidth bill from rackspace.
* Merged in lp:~jeffreydavidrogers/duplicity/duplicity
  - This change fixes two small typos in the duplicity man page.
* Merged in lp:~johnleach/duplicity/1315437-swift-container-create
  - Check to see if the swift container exists before trying to create it,
    in case we don't have permissions to create containers. Fixes #1315437
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/manpage.blocksize
  - add --max_blocksize doc
  - reorder 'a note on filename prefixes' into alphabetical order


New in v0.6.24 (2014/05/09)
---------------------------
Enhancements:
* Applied two patches from mailing list message at:
  https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/duplicity-talk/2014-01/msg00030.html
  "Added command line options to use different prefixes for duplicity files"
  This resolves https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1170161 and provides
  a workaround for https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1170113
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/gpg-encode
  - getpass.getpass(prompt) eventually calls str(prompt). Which is a no go,
    if the prompt contains unicode. Here's a patch to always pass getpass() a
    byte string.
  - Our tests didn't catch this because they always set PASSPHRASE. I've added
    a test that passes the passphrase via stdin.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/pexpect-fix
  - duplicity has its own copy of pexpect. Use that instead of requiring one
    from the system.
* Merged in lp:~prateek/duplicity/s3-glacier
  - Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1039511
    - Adds support to detect when a file is on Glacier and initiates a restore
      to S3. Also merges overlapping code in the boto backends
  - Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1243246
    - Adds a --s3_multipart_max_timeout input option to limit the max execution
      time of a chunked upload to S3. Also adds debug message to calculate
      upload speed.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/fix.dpbx
  - Fix dpbx backend "NameError: global name 'rest' is not defined"
* Merged in lp:~prateek/duplicity/botoimportfix
  - Switches the boto backend back to using lazy imports so there are no
    complaints during the importing of backends.
* Merged in lp:~germer/duplicity/par2
  - This branch adds Par2 recovery files to duplicity. It is a wrapper backend
    which will create the recovery files and upload them all together with the
    wrapped backend. Corrupt archives will be detected and repaired (if
    possible) on the fly during restore.
  - It can be used with url-string par2+webdavs://USER@HOST/PATH
  - Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/426282
* Merged in lp:~fredrik-loch/duplicity/duplicity-S3-SSE
  - Adds support for server side encryption as requested in Bug #996660
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/drop-u1
  - Ubuntu One is closing shop. So no need to support a u1 backend anymore.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/fix-drop-u1
  - Looks like when the drop-u1 branch got merged, its conflict got resolved
    badly. Here is the right version of backend.py to use (and also drops
    u1backend.py from POTFILES).
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/drop-pexpect
  - Drop our local copy of pexpect in favor of a system version.
  - It's only used by the pexpect ssh backend (and if you're opting into that,
    you probably can expect that you will need pexpect) and the tests.
  - I've done a quick smoketest (backed up and restored using
    --ssh-backend=pexpect) and it seemed to work fine with a modern version
    of pexpect.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/2.6isms
  - Here's a whole stack of minor syntax modernizations that will become
    necessary in python3. They all work in python.6.
  - I've added a new test to keep us honest and prevent backsliding on these
    modernizations. It runs 2to3 and will fail the test if 2to3 finds anything
    that needs fixing (with a specific set of exceptions carved out).
  - This branch has most of the easy 2to3 fixes, the ones with obvious and
    safe syntax changes.
  - We could just let 2to3 do them for us, but ideally we use 2to3 as little
    as possible, since it doesn't always know how to solve a given problem.
    I will propose a branch later that actually does use 2to3 to generate
    python3 versions of duplicity if they are requested. But this is a first
    step to clean up the code base.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/drop-static
  - Drop static.py.
  - This is some of the oldest code in duplicity! A bzr blame says it is
    unmodified (except for whitespace / comment changes) since revision 1.
  - But it's not needed anymore. Not really even since we updated to python.4,
    which introduced the @staticmethod decorator. So this branch drops it and
    its test file.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/encode-for-print
  - Encode translated strings before passing them to 'print'.
  - The print command can only apparently handle bytes. So when we pass it
    unicode, it freaks out. There were only four instances I saw where we used
    print, so I figured it was easiest to just convert them to use the log
    framework too.
  - That way all user-visible strings go through that framework and are subject
    to the same encoding rules.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/more-test-reorg
  - Here's another test reorganization / modernization branch. It does the
    following things:
    - Drop duplicity/misc.py. It is confusing to have both misc.py and util.py,
      and most of the code in misc.py was no longer used. I moved the one
      function that was still used into util.py.
    - Consolidated the various ways to run tests into just one. I made tox runs
      go through ./setup.py test, rather than nosetests. And I made the
      ./testing/run-tests scripts just call tox. Now we no longer need nosetests
      as a test dependency (although you can still use it if you want).
    - Added two more code quality automated tests: a pep8 one and a pylint one.
      I disabled almost all checks in each program that gave a warning. These
      tests just establish a baseline for future improvement.
    - Moved the test helper code into TestCase subclasses that all tests can
      use. And used more code sharing and setUp/tearDown cleverness to remove
      duplicated code.
    - Reorganized the tests in ./testing/tests into ./testing/functional and
      ./testing/unit -- for whether they drive duplicity as a subprocess or
      whether they import and test code directly. Each dir can have specialized
      TestCase subclasses now.
    - Renamed the files in ./testing/unit to more clearly indicate which file
      in ./duplicity they are unit testing.
    - Added some helper methods for tests to set environment and globals.*
      parameters more safely (i.e. without affecting other tests) by
      automatically cleaning up any such changes during test tearDown.
    - Removed test_unicode.py, since it is kind of dumb. It used to be more
      useful, but now with py2.6, we are just testing that one line of code
      in it is actually there.
* Fixed bug #1312328 WebDAV backend can't understand 200 OK response to DELETE
  - Allow both 200 and 204 as valid response to delete
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/py3-map-filter
  - In py3, map and filter return iterable objects, not lists. So in each case
    we use them, I've either imported the future version or switched to a list
    comprehension if we really wanted a list.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/backend-unification
  - Reorganize and simplify backend code.  Specifically:
    - Formalize the expected API between backends and duplicity.  See the new
      file duplicity/backends/README for the instructions I've given authors.

      par2+gio+file://blah/blah.
    - The switch to control which cloudfiles backend had a typo.  I fixed this,
      but I'm not sure I should have?  If we haven't had complaints, maybe we
      can just drop the old backend.
    - I manually tested all the backends we have (except hsi and tahoe -- but
      those are simple wrappers around commands and I did test those via mocks
      per above).  I also added a bunch more manual backend tests to
      ./testing/manual/backendtest.py, which can now be run like the above to
      test all the files you have configured in config.py or you can pass it a
      URL which it will use for testing (useful for backend authors).
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/encode-exceptions
  - Because exceptions often contain file paths, they have the same problem
    with Python 2.x's implicit decoding using the 'ascii' encoding that we've
    experienced before.  So I added a new util.uexc() method that uses the
    util.ufn() method to convert an exception to a unicode string and used it
    around the place.
  - Bugs fixed: 1289288, 1311176, 1313966

New in v0.6.23 (2014/01/24)
---------------------------
Enhancements:
* Applied patch from bug 1216921 to fix ignore_missing().
  - merged lp:~mterry/duplicity/ignore-missing to fix patch.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/catch-seq-copy-error
  - Any* exception when running patch_seq2ropath should be ignored (though
    logged) and duplicity should move on. This covers the two asserts in that
    function (bug 1155345 and bug 720525) as well as errors that happen during
    file copying (bug 662442).
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/argv
  - Fix use of argv when calling os.execve
* Merged in lp:~verb/duplicity/bucket_root_fix
  - Fixed bug that prevents backing up to the root of a bucket with boto backend.
* Merged in lp:~gliptak/duplicity/415619
  - Better error message when chown fails
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/log-path-type
  - Any backup browser built on top of duplicity will need to indicate which
    files in the backup are folders and which are files. The current logging
    information doesn't provide this detail. So I've added a field to the
    log.InfoCode.file_list output that includes the path type.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/manifest-oddities
  - We may accidentally end up with an oddly inconsistent manifest like so:
    Volume 1
    Volume 2
    Volume 3
    Volume 2
    As did get reported recently on the mailing list:
    http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/duplicity-talk/2013-11/msg00009.html
  - One way this can happen (the only way?) is if you back up, then duplicity
    gets interrupted between writing the manifest and uploading the volume.
    Then, when restarted, there is no longer enough data to create as many
    volumes as existed previously.
  - This situation can cause an exception when trying to restart the backup.
  - This branch fixes it by deleting any excess volume information encountered
    when loading in the manifest. We discard volume with higher numbers
    than the last one read.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/disappearing-source
  - When restarting a backup, we may accidentally skip the first chunk of one of
    the source files. To reproduce this,:
    1) interrupt a backup
    2) delete the source file it was in the middle of
    3) restart the backup
  - When replaying the source iterator to find where to resume from, we can't
    notice that the file is gone until we've already iterated past where it
    would be!
  - The solution I came up with is to just let duplicity stuff the data we
    accidentally read back into the source iterator.
  - This is actually a data loss bug, because it's possible to back up
    corrupted files (that are missing their first chunk).
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/normalize-before-using
  - Avoid throwing an exception due to a None element in a patch sequence.
  - None elements in a (non-normalized) patch sequence are perfectly normal.
    With the current code in the patched function, it is certainly possible to
    hit a crash due a None.
    See http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/duplicity-talk/2013-11/msg00005.html
  - This branch fixes that by normalizing the sequence before using it in the
    logging code. It's acceptable to bring the normalize_ps() call outside the
    try/except block because normalize_ps is not expected to throw. It's
    relatively simple and doesn't really use its objects besides checking if
    they are None.
* Applied patch to fix "Access GDrive through gdocs backend failing"
  - see https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/duplicity-talk/2013-07/msg00007.html
* Merged in lp:~jkrauss/duplicity/pyrax
  - Rackspace has deprecated python-cloudfiles in favor of their pyrax
    library, which consolidates all Rackspace Cloud API functionality into
    a single library.  Tested it with Duplicity 0.6.21 on both Arch Linux
    and FreeBSD 8.3.0.
* Changed to default to pyrax backend rather than cloudfiles backend.
  To revert to the cloudfiles backend use '--cf-backend=cloudfiles'
* Merged in lp:~verb/duplicity/boto-min-version
  - Update documentation and error messages to match the current actual version
    requirements of boto backend.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/debian.paramiko.log
  - upstream debian patch "paramiko logging"
    http://patch-tracker.debian.org/package/duplicity/0.6.22-2
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/debian.dav.mkdir
  - upstream debian patch "webdav create folder recursively"
    http://patch-tracker.debian.org/package/duplicity/0.6.22-2
* Nuke tabs
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/encoding
  - This branch hopefully fixes two filename encoding issues:
  - Users in bug 989496 were noticing a UnicodeEncodeError exception which
    happens (as far as I can tell) because some backends (like webdav) are
    returning unicode filenames from list(). When these filenames are combined
    with the utf8 translations of log messages, either (A) the default ascii
    encoding can't handle promoting the utf8 bytes or -- if there aren't any
    utf8 bytes in the translation -- (B) the resulting unicode string raises
    an error later when log.py tries to upgrade the string again to unicode
    for printing.
  - This fix is largely implemented by adding a wrapper for backend list()
    implementations. This wrapper ensures that duplicity internals always see
    a byte string. (I'd like to eventually use this same wrapping strategy to
    implement generic retry support without backends having to add any logic,
    but that's just a thought for the future.)
  - That is, the fix for issue #1 is completely inside backend.py and the
    changes to backends/*.py.
  - The rest of the invasive changes deal with filenames that may not be valid
    utf8. This is much rarer, but possible. For proper handling of this, we
    need to print using unicode, and convert filenames from the system filename
    encoding to unicode, gracefully handling conversion errors. Some of the
    filenames we print are remote names. Who knows what encoding they are in;
    it could be different than the system filename encoding. 99% of the time,
    everything will be utf8 and we're fine. If we do get conversion errors,
    the only effect should be some question mark characters in duplicity
    logging output.
  - I tried to convert as much of the actual codebase to use unicode for
    printing. But I stopped short of adding an assert in log.py to enforce
    unicode, because I didn't want to go through all the backend code and
    manually adjust those bits without being able to test each one.
* Restored missing line from patch of gdocsbackend.py
* Reverted changes to gdocsbackend.py
* Restored patch of gdocsbackend.py from original author (thanks ede)
* Applied patch from bug 1266753: Boto backend removes local cache if
  connection cannot be made
* Merged in lp:~louis-bouchard/duplicity/add-allow-concurrency
  - Implement locking mechanism to avoid concurrent execution under the same
    cache directory. This is the default behavior.
  - Also implement --alllow-concurrency option to disable the locking
    if required.
  - This functionality adds a dependency to python-lockfile


New in v0.6.22 (2013/08/22)
---------------------------
Enhancements:
* Applied patches from Laszlo Ersek to rdiffdir to "consume a chain of sigtar
  files in rdiffdir delta mode" which supports incremental sigtar files.
* Merged in lp:~jnoster/duplicity/dpbx-added
  - Add Dropbox backend
  - NB! In order to use the backend one must:
    1. Install Dropbox Python SDK first.
    2. Run the duplicity with Dropbox backend (dpbx://) first time
       *interactively* to catch and follow the oAuth URL.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/verify.data
  - add switch --compare-data, to selectively enable formerly always disabled
    data comparison on verify runs
* Merged in lp:~tblue/duplicity/paramiko-1.10.0
  - This fixes bug #1156746, making the Paramiko backend compatible with
    Paramiko 1.10.0. It keeps compatibility with older Paramiko versions.
* Merged in lp:~townsend/duplicity/fix-1161599-2
  - The fix in revno. 912 didn't take into account that the parameter "body"
    passed into request() is overloaded, so when it was NULL or of a type other
    than file, it would fail.  This checks if "body" is of type "file" before
    actually seek()'ing back to the beginning of the file.
* Merged in lp:~tblue/duplicity/paramiko-fix-delete-retry
  - This fixes bug #1115715, which is really annoying. Basically it makes
    using the Paramiko backend with the default settings impossible.
* Merged in lp:~juan-f/duplicity/progress
  - From time ago, there are people asking for a progress bar estimation in duplicity.
    There is even a script that circumvents the issue, getting info from the log so as
    to estimate the progress status ( https://github.com/quentin/Duplicity-progress )
    but does not give enough feedback and the estimation is rather plain.
  - I have developed a set of heuristics that gather information from the deltas and
    the transfer ratios of the backend so as to forecast % of progress, estimation of
    remaining time and average speed, for both full and incremental backup uploads.
  - The current implementation works for boto backend, but to port the other backends
    to use this feature would be quite easy (we can discuss the details if interested).
  - The algorithm is activated by the --progress command line flag, and will perform a
    first-pass dry-run to collect evidence for all the deltas. Next it will trigger the
    real upload, while a thread statistically estimates the ratio of changes and
    compression for the data in/out, and uses these ratios to forecast time remaining
    and % of completion.
  - The progress data will be logged each 3 seconds, or the --progress-rate flag.
* Merged in lp:~jnoster/duplicity/dpbx-added
  - The application key was approved as "production" one after some changes to the code
    to suit the requirements of Dropbox team (the keys are now obfuscated, for instance).
* Applied blocksize.patch from https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/897423
  - New option --max-blocksize (default 2048) to allow increasing delta blocksize.
* Applied duplicity-ftps.patch from https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1104069
  - Don't try to delete an empty file list.
* Merged in lp:~scowcron/duplicity/ftp_password_pexpect
  - Use common backend.Backend get_password() rather than _ssh_pexpect.py specific code.
* Merged in lp:~mhu-s/duplicity/swiftbackend
  - This branch adds support for Swift, the OpenStack Object Storage service. See
    https://blueprints.launchpad.net/duplicity/+spec/swiftbackend
* Merged in lp:~verb/duplicity/boto-gcs
  - These patches add support for Google Cloud Storage via the boto backend.
  - boto has supported GCS in interoperability mode for a few years now. This change
    adds support by taking advantage of boto's storage_uri abstraction layer.
* Merged in lp:~ckornacker/duplicity/megacloud
  - Add support for Mega (mega.co.nz) backend.
* Applied patch from Eric S Raymond to man page to fix markup problems.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/man.page
  - update paramiko links
  - add command parameters to synopsis
  - add --compare-data
  - some polishing and several improvements


New in v0.6.21 (2013/01/23)
---------------------------
Enhancements:
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/24syntaxfix
  - fix python 2.4 vs 2.5 syntax error
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/u1-oauthlib
  - As the Ubuntu packager for duplicity, I would prefer u1backend.py
    used oauthlib instead of oauth.  oauthlib is well maintained upstream
    (unlike oauth), has a python3 port (for the future), and is in Ubuntu
    main (so is oauth right now, but hopefully in the future we can drop
    it to universe, in which case duplicity can't use it anymore).
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/delete-new-sig-in-cache
  - In duplicity 0.6.20, we fixed bug 1031269. This means that we no longer
    leave sig files on the remote location.  Leaving sig files on the remote
    location also caused a bug with deleting cache files. Code used to leave
    remote new-sig but delete the locale cache new-sig; this meant that we would
    keep downloadoing the new-sig all the time from remote. We had worked around
    that by just not deleting the new-sig in the cache, which was sort of the
    wrong side of that problem to tackle.  Now that we handle the remote
    new-sigs better (by deleting them), I don't think we need this code anymore.
    Patch by az@debian.org.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/u1-ascii-error
  - Fix for u1backend unicode error.  Patch by Paul Barker.
* Merged in lp:~satwell/duplicity/caching
  - Add a cache for password and group lookups. This significantly improves
    runtime with very large password and group configurations.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/manpage
  - more formatting fixes, clarifications in sections EXAMPLES, FILE SELECTION
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/lftp.netrc
  - Allow .netrc auth for lftp backend
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/946988
  - This fixes bug 946988 by not duplicating the checks for when we should ask
    for the password (those same checks are done more correctly inside
    get_passphrase). And add a test to reproduce the bug.
* Merged in lp:~lenharo-h/duplicity/duplicity
  - Generate encrypted backups without revealing the user's key id
    via option --hidden-encrypt-key
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/u1-utf8
  - Make sure u1backend returns filenames as utf8
* Merged in lp:~carlos-abalde/duplicity/gdocs-backend-gdata-2.0.16.-upgrade
  - Upgrade of GoogleDocs backend to python gdata lib >= 2.0.15:
    Stop using get_everything method.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/webdav.fix-retry
  - bugfix: webdav retrying broke on ERRORS like "error: [Errno 32] Broken pipe" in
    socket.pyas reported here https://answers.launchpad.net/duplicity/+question/212966
    added a more generalized 'retry_fatal' decorator which makes retrying backend
    methods even easier
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/manpage
  - Clear up PASSPHRASE reusage as sign passphrase.  Minor fixes.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/u1_and_manpage
  - Manpage
    - document Ubuntu One required python libs
    - added continuous contributors and backend author notes
  - U1backend
    - lazily import non standard python libs, fixes
    http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.sysutils.backup.duplicity.general/5753
    - fix "not bytearray" prevents PUT with python 2.6
    - don't hang after putting in credentials (cause it silently retries in background)
      but go through with backup
* Fixed 1091269 Data corruption when resuming with --no-encryption
  - Patches from Pascual Abellan that make block size consistent and
    that add -n (no-encryption) option to manual-ctrl-c-test.sh.
  - Modified gpg.py patch to use 64k block size so unit test passes.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/static-corruption
  - This branch fixes three possible ways a backup could get data-corrupted.
    Inspired by bug 1091269.
      A) If resuming after a volume that ended in a one-block file, we would
         skip the first block of the next file.
      B) If resuming after a volume that ended in a multi-block file, we would
         skip the first block of the next file.
      C) If resuming after a volume that spanned a multi-block file, we would
         skip some data inside the file.
  - A and B are because when finding the right place in the source files to
    restart the backup, the iteration loop didn't handle None block numbers
    very well (which are used to indicate the end of a file).
  - C is what bug 1091269 talks about. This was because data block sizes would
    get smaller as the difftar file got closer and closer to the volsize.
    Standard block sizes were 64 * 1024.  But say we were close to the end of
    the difftar... When resuming, duplicity doesn't know the custom block sizes
    used by the previous run, so it uses standard block sizes. And it doesn't
    always match up, as you can imagine. So we would leave chunks of data out
    of the backed up file.
  - Tests added for these cases.
  - This branch is called 'static-corruption' because all these issues occur
    even when the source data doesn't change. I still think there are some
    corruption issues when a file changes in between duplicity runs. I haven't
    started looking into that yet, but that's next on my list.
  - C only happened without encryption (because the gpg writer function already
    happened to force a constant data block size). A and B happened with or
    without encryption.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/webdav.fix-retry
  - added ssl certificate verification (see man page)
  - more robust retry routine to survive ssl errors, broken pipe errors
  - added http redirect support
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/webdav.manpage
  - explanation of webdav changes above
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/pygi
  - Python bindings for the gobject stack (used in the gio backend) have changed
    from static to dynamically-generated bindings. The old static bindings are
    deprecated. So here's a branch to change the gio backend from old to new ones.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/py3rsync
  - This branch lets one build the _librsync module with Python 3. You can't
    really do anything useful with it, but it's a nicely-isolated piece to add
    Python 3 support for.
  - The changes are a mix of modernization and #ifdef logic.
  - All tests still pass in Python 2.7 and 2.4. I tested manually that the module
    worked as expected in Python 3.
* Merged in lp:~duplicity-team/duplicity/po-updates
  - Updated translations


New in v0.6.20 (2012/10/28)
---------------------------
Enhancements:
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/ssh.manpage
  - added gdocs and rsync REQUIREMENTS
  - added cloudfiles documentation
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/gpginterface
  - refactor GnuPGInterface to gpginterface.py
    reasoning can be found in README
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/duplicity.helpfix
  - fix rare 'TypeError: encode() argument 1 must be string, not None'
  - http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/duplicity-talk/2012-09/msg00016.html
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/duplicity.tmpspacefix
  - use tempfile.TemporaryFile() so unused temp files are deleted automagically
  - propbably solve bug 'Out of space error while restoring a file'
  - https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1005901
  - http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/duplicity-talk/2012-09/msg00000.html
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/utf8-po
  - For some crazy reason, the gettext module defaults to giving you strings in
    whatever charset the po file happened to define.  Which means you never know
    what string of bytes you're going to get.  This module makes sure we always
    get utf-8 byte strings.  So we're at least predictable and reduces one
    source of UnicodeDecodeErrors (like in bug 989496)
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/1031277
  - ssh: actually delete all the requested files, not just the first one
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/leftover-sigtar
  - So currently, duplicity does not delete signature files when doing a
    remove-all-but-n operation. Seems wrong, since those signature files are now
    useless and take up space.
  - This branch does several things:
    1) Make remove-all-but-n operate on chains. In practice it did before, since
       the sets it operated on always came from complete chains (i.e. it never
       used only some of the sets from a chain)
    2) Add a new method to get all signature chains before a certain time.
    3) Use this new method to also delete signature chains during remove-all-but
       operations.
  - And it cleans up the cleanuptest.py file:
    1) Removes crufty, unused code
    2) Disallows changing the destination folder for the test, which no one
       would ever want to do and isn't really supported anyway
    3) Add some additional checks to the existing test
    4) Adds two new methods to test remove-all-but-n and
       remove-all-inc-of-but-n-full
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/duplicity.manpage
  - disabled hyphenation and block justification for better readablility of
    command line examples.
  - reformatted REQUIREMENTS section for hopefully better online rendering
  - minor clarifications
* Merged in lp:~gregretkowski/duplicity/cf-retry-delete
  - This will retry cloudfile delete commands. With large numbers of archive
    files over mediocre links transient network errors will occasionally cause
    deletes to fail and these should be retried.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/ropath.index
  - This branch does two main things:
    1) Skips base dir entries when compiling the list of deleted delta iters.
       (this gracefully recovers from the sort of situations that lead to bug
       929067). I'm reasonably confident this is an uninvasive change, but
       please confirm.
    2) Overwrites the sigtar file on backup-restart. This is because AFAICT,
       duplicity will rewrite the entire sigtar each restart. But we were
       opening the sigtar file as "ab", so we'd just dump the contents on top
       of the previous contents. Which was causing some confusion in bug 929067.
       If I'm wrong that we don't always rewrite the entire sigtar each time,
       this needs some rethink. Please also confirm that.
  - In addition, I added two tests for the above two changes and make some
    improvements elsewhere in the restarttest.py file while I was at it.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/ssh-pexpect-msgbug
  - Fixes 'UnboundLocalError: local variable 'msg' referenced before assignment'
    in _ssh_pexpect.py
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/gpg.tmp
  - place gpg.py tempfiles in duplicity's tmp subfolder which is cleaned
    whatever happens
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/u1-402
  - Switch the code we check for out-of-space in u1backend.
* Applied patch for #1066625 ubuntu one backend
  - add delay between retries

---------------------------
Enhancements:

  same bucket.  See blueprint at
  https://blueprints.launchpad.net/duplicity/+spec/file-prefix-option
* two changes that help the test suite pass
* raise log level on backend import failure so it will be visible under default
  conditions
* file /etc/motd may not exist in test environment.  Use __file__ instead to
  point to a known plaintext source file.
* some code/import changes to make the ssh and boto backends compatible with
  Python 2.4.
* some changes to make roottest.py compatible with the new dir structure.

New in v0.6.17 (2011/11/25)
---------------------------
Enhancements:
* Added --rsync-options flag to allow user to pass options to rsync at will
* Added --s3-use-multiprocessing to select the new s3 multiprocessing backend.
  Default is to use the single processing backend.  A helper, filechunkio.py,
  requires Python 2.6+, so this option is not usable in earlier versions.

Fix problems with unittests under Jaunty.  It appears that redirection
in os.system() has changed for the worse, so a workaround for now.

Fix problem in restart where there were no manifest entries and no
remote volumes stored.  We clean out the partial and restart.

Fixed 435975 gpg asks for password in 0.6.05, but not in 0.5.18


New in v0.6.05 (2009/08/28)
---------------------------
Merged in lp:~l2g/duplicity/test-compat from Larry Gilbert which made
the testing compatible across more systems.  Also fixed the remaining
collectionstest bug which was trying to test with no cache present.

418170  [PATCH] file names longer then 512 symbols are not supported


New in v0.6.04 (2009/08/01)
---------------------------
One major and one minor change.  The "No such file or directory" error
is bad enough that this should be released quickly.  For those of you
using encryption, this is not a problem, but for those of you that do
not use encryption (--no-encryption), then this will manifest itself if
the local cache gets out of sync with the remote store.

Bugs fixed this release:
405734  duplicity fails to restore files that contain a newline character
403790  Backup error: No such file or directory


New in v0.6.03 (2009/07/29)
---------------------------
Lots of small changes and some bug fixes.
* Restart error handling has been smoothed out a great deal and it
  "does what is right" in order to keep going.
* Backends are now optional, if they fail an Info message is put out
  to notify of the failure and why.
* There was more work on translations and internationalization.
Thanks to everyone!

Bugs fixed this release:

New in v0.6.02 (2009/07/07)
---------------------------
Duplicity will now remove any spurious files left in the cache from
a previous run.  This will keep the metadata cache in sync with the
remote storage metadata.

Bugs fixed this release:
394629  Hang on first collection-status
379386  Fix 'list-current-files' with missing archive dir
395826  "No such file or directory" when backing up second time
394627  User-friendly archive dir print
388699  Manifest mismatch error


New in v0.6.01 (2009/07/01)
---------------------------
Fixed issues in Checkpoint/Restart:
* The --name backupname" option was added to allow the
  user to separate one archive from another.  If not
  specified, the default is an MD5 hash of the target
  URL, which should suffice for most uses.

* The archive_dir (cache) is now stored in a standard
  location, defaulting to ~/.cache/duplicity.  See
  http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/

* The interaction between the --archive-dir option and
  the --name option allows for four possible results
  for the location of the archive dir.
    - neither specified (default)
      ~/.cache/duplicity/hash-of-url
    - --archive-dir=~/arch, no --name
      ~/arch/hash-of-url
    - no --archive-dir, --name=foo
      ~/.cache/duplicity/foo
    - --archive-dir=~/arch, --name=foo
      ~/arch/foo

* duplicity will now copy needed metadata from the
  remote store to the local cache as needed.  This
  means that the first use after upgraded from 0.5.x
  will have the metadata copied to the local archive
  dir in order to sync both.

* cleanup will now work correctly with the archive
  dir and separates the local from the remote files.

Bugs fixed this release:
* 388034     Unable to backup
* 378940     python-6 issue / UTF-8 charset / Ubuntu 9.04
* 379386     Fix list-current-files w/ missing archive dir
* 387102     Asynchronous upload not working properly
* 387218     Make scp/ssh into sftp-only backend

* 392905     NoneType object has no attribute 'startswith'
* 393372     Error creating directory
* 383412     Add InfoCodes for upload events
* 383419     Add gio backend


New in v0.6.00 (2009/06/08)
---------------------------
Checkpoint/Restart capability added.  Checkpoint is
done at every volume written and Restart is done at
start of the next volume in the set.  Changes to
normal operations include a permanent duplicity
archive-dir at ~/.duplicity to save state.

To accomplish this, the signature and archive files
in the archive-dir now have three states:
1) temporary until the first volume has been written,
2) partial until the final volume has been written and
   sent to remote storage,
3) permanent with the same name as always.

Assumptions are made that if a restart is needed, then
all arguments are the same as before and that no files
have been removed from the file system between runs.

From now on, the --archive-dir option can be used to
change the location of the archive dir, but you are
responsible for moving the files if you change it.

Other fixes:
Unicode filenames in log messages are now OK.

Fixed problem where Cygwin was returning -1 for the
hard max open file limit.


New in v0.5.18 (2009/05/20)
---------------------------
Added support for RackSpace's CloudFiles, cf+http.

Added support for Tahoe-LAFS from the patch,
patch #6743: Tahoe backend for duplicity
https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6743

Only half of this bug is fixed but it's still useful.
bug #21792: pipe call fails with an error OSError:
            [Errno 24] Too many open files
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?21792

Changed from using ulimit external command to
resource.getrlimit to check open files limit.


New in v0.5.17 (2009/05/04)
---------------------------
Removed one line of code left from some testing that I
did that caused a crash when the target dir was empty
and collection-status was requested.

Moved from using the df command to get temp space
availability to Python's os.statvfs() call.  Not all
df commands work the same way.

patch #6806: More graceful handling of old
             --short-filename files
https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6806

Added tilde and variable expansion to the source or
target argument that is not a URL.


New in v0.5.15 (2009/04/09)
---------------------------
FTP backend was failing on PureFTPd when the "-x ''"
option was removed from the second ncftpls popen, a fix
that was implemented due to bug #24741.  This fix does
the ls in one pass by extracting the last entry on the
'ls -l' listing.

If a file is unreadable due to access rights or other
non-fatal errors, put out error message and continue
rather than dying messily with a traceback.

Added tilde '~' expansion and variable expansion in the
options that require a filename.  You can now have this
"--archive-dir=~/ArchDir/$SYSNAME" if you need it.  No
expansion is applied to the source or target URL's.

Fixed problem I caused, again, where sys.exit() was
trapping instead of exiting.  Added big note to not
to do that again.


New in v0.5.14 (2009/04/02)
---------------------------
After email voting among known duplicity contributors,
the decision was reached to revert to the GPL Version 2
license, so with their consensus, duplicity is now under
GPL Version 2.

Revert to calling NcFTP utilities (ls, get, put) directly
rather than scripting ncftp via pexpect by reverting to the
0.5.07 version of ftpbackend.py.

Changed fatal error regarding version 3.2.0 of ncftpput to
warning level since it has been reported that the problem
does not occur on most distributions.

Changed from log.Log with numbered log levels to log.Debug,
log.Info, log.Notice, log.Warn, log.FatalError as below:
    0    log.FatalError
    1-2  log.Warn
    3-4  log.Notice
    5-8  log.Info
    9 log.Debug
The -vN option has not changed.  Verbosity may also be one
of: character [ewnid], or word ['error', 'warning', 'notice',
'info', 'debug'].  The default is 4 (Notice).  The options
-v4, -vn, and -vnotice are functionally equivalent, as are
the mixed-case versions, -vN, -vNotice, -vNOTICE.

Normalized include statements and tried to insure that all
duplicity includes were from the duplicity module.

patch #6790: Add --exclude-if-present
https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6790


New in v0.5.13 (2009/03/26)
---------------------------
Add more error detection to FTP backend.

Fix backends so sleep does not occur after last retry.

Fix so BackendException does not cause traceback except when
verbosity is at level 5 or higher (Info level).

Adjust log levels so some errors show up with default verbosity.

Fixed bug where an extra comma caused a traceback during a warning
about unnecessary sig files.  Plus fixed print so the real filename
would show up and not a Python object representation.

Add Changelog.GNU to website and distribution to add a bit of detail
showing the CVS changes via rcs2log.  Added dist/mkGNUChangelog.sh.

bug #22908: Don't block gpg-agent
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?22908

To fix the above, --use-agent was added as a command line option.
When this is specified and asymetric encryption is enabled, then all
GnuPG passphrases will come from the gpg-agent or equivalent program
and no passphrase prompt will be issued.

bug #25787: Usernames with escaped @-sign are not handled properly
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?25787

bug #25976: Password requested when not needed.
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?25976

patch #6787: import duplicity.GnuPGInterface explicitly
https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6787


New in v0.5.12 (2009/03/15)
---------------------------
bug #25838: Backup fails / ncftp - remote file already exists
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?25838
With this fix we also get resume in ftp get/put.  If a put or
get fails part of the way through, ncftp will resume on the
next retry.

bug #25853: duplicity fails with boto passwords coming from ~/.boto
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?25853

patch #6773: Make user name optional in rsync backend
https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6773

GPG errors will no longer cause tracebacks, but will produce a
log entry, from gpg, similar to the following:
===== Begin GnuPG log =====
gpg: BAD0BAD0: skipped: public key not found
gpg: [stdin]: encryption failed: public key not found
===== End GnuPG log =====
This will let the user know what really caused the GPG process
to fail, and what really caused errors like 'broken pipe'.

---------------------------
The default filename format has changed from W3 style to a long
numeric style, YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ, with no delimiters, thus is now
compatible with Windows/Samba filesystems.  The time is UTC, not
local, so there will be no timezone or daylight savings time issues.

Duplicity still recognizes the old long filename format, and will
continue incremental backup chains if found.  The old format is
still available via the --old-filenames option (pending deprecation).

Users of --short-filenames or --time-separator should stop using these
options on their next full backup.  The new filenames are compatible
with your system.

The following options are pending deprecation and will be removed in a
future release:
    --time-separator
    --short-filenames
    --old-filenames

https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6730

patch #6733: Improve error handling in imapbackend.py
https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6733

Increase default volume size (--volsize) to 25M from 5M.  This
reduces the number of volumes to accomodate larger backups.

Reworked patch 6701 to list collection one at a time rather than
writing all as one huge list.  Was causing memeory problems when
the collections got large.

Fix backendtest.py so that empty URL's in config.py cause the
backend test to be skipped rather than erroring.  Added notes
in config.py.tmpl explaining the change.

Add/update copyright statements in all distribution source files
and revert duplicity to GPL version 2 license.

Original fix to disallow use of ncftpput 3.2.0 mistyped the ErrorCode
used and resulted in an error rather than an explanation.


New in v0.5.06 (2009/01/09)
---------------------------
Fix to deprecation warnings about sha and md5 modules.
Uses hashlib if available, otherwise original module.

Added loop to run-all-tests.sh to run all tests against all supported
versions of Python if available.  Looks for 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6.

Noah Spurrier has given us permission to distribute pexpect.py along
with duplicity, so this will no longer be an install requirement.

NcFTP version 3.2.0 will not work with duplicity since we require the
use of both -f and -C options on ncftpput.  3.1.9, 3.2.1+ work fine.
I put in error checks for this situation in the FTP backend code.

Fix problem where S3 prefix was prepended with 'd'.  This caused

New in v0.4.9 (2008/01/04)
--------------------------
NOTE: URL format correction in rsync://.  The rsync backend
now properly supports absolute and relative pathnames and
module access.  The formats are:
    rsync://user@host::/module/some_dir
    rsync://user@host/relative_path
    rsync://user@host//absolute_path

Fixed regression caused by changeover to new urlparse.py.
bug #21475: FTP Usernames that contain '@' are not recognized
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?21475

Added section URL FORMAT in the duplicity man page.

Added 2nd patch to bug #21475 that forces all versions of
Python to use the fixed urlparse.py.

Fixed so that remove-older-than and remove-all-but-n-full
will not request a GPG passphrase.

Fixed issue with Pure-FTPd that would always return an empty
directory listing and thus force a full backup every time.
A side effect of the change is that we now only make one call
to ncftpls to get the listing, thereby reducing the overhead
on systems with a large number of backup files.

New in v0.4.8 (2007/12/15)
--------------------------
First pass at bringing unittest cases up to date.
All unit tests are working, but more test cases need
to be added to handle the new protocols, plus there is
some print leakage even with logging turned off.

Allow pexpect to force the close of the child on sftp
calls.  We already do that with scp calls.  This cleans
up that exception.

--------------------------
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?21646
Fix to handling of collections when --archive-dir is used.
Prior to this, duplicity would write the full sig files to
both local and remote, then delete the remote.  Now, it does
not delete the remote full sigs.

Applied the following patches from Peter Schuller
patch #6279, add command 'remove-all-but-n-full'
patch #6280, clarify --archive-dir option
patch #6281, --help should print to stdout, not stderr
patch #6282, collection-status: output in more consistent order


New in v0.4.4 (2007/11/23)
--------------------------
All the changes in RC1 through RC4 plus:

Changes to ftpBackend to use a temp login config file rather
than putting the username and password on the command line.
This requires the use of NcFTP 3.1.9 or later.

Thanks to a patch from Greg Hewgill the Amazon S3 backend now
uses --num-retries to retry IO repeatedly if needed.

Changes to commandline processing to allow non-ambiguous short
strings for commands, i.e. 'i', 'inc', 'incr' for 'incremental',
'f' for 'full', etc..  A warning message is printed if the short
command is not unique.  Note: this already works for options, so
I just applied the same idea to commands.

Applied a patch from Gregory Hartman to correct handling of DST
in time calculations.  This affects backups made the night of
a DST time switch.


New in v0.4.4.RC4 (2007/10/26)
------------------------------
WARNING:  COMMAND LINE CHANGES ARE NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE!
There is a new command line syntax to separate actions and
options.  Refer to the new man page for full details of the
change.  The new syntax looks like:
    duplicity [full|incr] [options] source_dir target_url
    duplicity [restore] [options] source_url target_dir
    duplicity verify [options] source_url target_dir
    duplicity collection-status [options] target_url
    duplicity list-current-files [options] target_url
    duplicity cleanup [options] target_url
    duplicity remove-older-than time [options] target_url

Fixed issue in --time-separator where the current time string
was being set prior to setting the separator, causing errors
when trying to set the --time-separator for Windows systems.

Fix so that file mtime is always compared in full seconds.

Fix so that ftpBackend.delete() does not print file list.


New in v0.4.4.RC3 (2007/10/02)
------------------------------
Patch from Olivier Croquette to add --full-if-older-than=<time>
option to force a full backup at <time> rather than incremental.

Patch from Stefan Hoth to add :port option in FTP.

Patch from Mitchell Garnaat to get all keys from S3, rather
than just the first 1000.

Fix to sshBackend to version check for python-pexpect 2.1.

Fix one case in ftpBackend where host string was used instead of
url_string.  This only affected the creation of the target dir on
the remote system, if it did not exist, and only if the user or
port needed to be specified.


New in v0.4.4.RC2 (2007/09/26)
------------------------------
Added --timeout <seconds> (default 30) to allow users to change
duplicity's network timeout settings.

Added --time-separator <char> to allow users to change the time
separator from ':' to another character that will work on their
system.  HINT: For Windows SMB shares, use --time-separator='_'.
NOTE: '-' is not valid as it conflicts with date separator.

Add patch from Alexander Zangerl to suppress the GPG passphrase
prompt when a passphrase is not needed.
 - full and pubkey enc:  doesn't depend on old encrypted info
 - inc and pubkey enc and archive-dir: need manifest and sigs,
   which the archive dir contains unencrypted
 - with encryption disabled
 - listing files:  needs manifest, but the archive dir has that
 - collection status:  only looks at a repository

Add patch from Olivier Croquette to allow user@domain usernames,
making ftp://user@domain@domain.com/path a valid URL.

Added a bit of debug print to sshBackend for --verbosity=9.

Changed usage message to separate options and commands.


New in v0.4.4.RC1 (2007/09/19)
------------------------------
Patches applied from Debian
DP: fix #228388: old/aborted/offending sig files prohibit further action

https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6205
Add option --librsync-dir for when its not found.


New in v0.4.3 (2007/08/20)
--------------------------
All the changes in RC1 through RC12 plus:

Move get_password() to Backend class to standardize.

Fix problem with ftpBackend to create target directory
if needed.  Note: this creates only one level.

Dropped ssh-command and added ssh-options to allow users
to add options to the scp and sftp commmands.

Removed use of tempfile.TemporaryFile().  This fixes the
restore problem on Windows that was due to Python bug
1776696 reported on Sourceforge.

Fixed Debian Bug#437694: Make bzip2 compression optional.
The default is not to do bzip2 compression.  To use bzip2
add the following command line option:
--gpg-options='--compress-algo=bzip2 --bzip2-compress-level=9'
Note: do not add spaces in the string value.

Fixed bug 20764 - unable to use port in ssh backend.
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?20764

Remove ssh_command option, add ssh_options.  This adds
options to the scp and sftp commands that are used by
the ssh backend.

Change ssh backend to send 'quit' instead of EOF when
using sftp.  This allows it to run under cron as long
as the password is supplied non-interactively.

Change ssh backend to not pass :port part of URL to
scp or sftp.  We already supply -oPort=xx for port.


New in v0.4.3.RC12 (2007/08/09)
-------------------------------
Fix index out of range in Bug 20730, triggered when there
is only one incremental in the list.
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?20730

Changed the file:, ftp:, and ssh: backends so that
the target directory will be created at start.

Changed the ftp: backend so that empty target dirs
do not error out.


New in v0.4.3.RC11 (2007/07/20)
-------------------------------
Duplicity is now covered under GPL version 3 (or later).

Duplicity now correctly processes scp URL's of the form:
  scp://user@host[:port]/
where the directory spec is empty.  This fixes a bug where the
user could not write into the home directory on the target.

The SSH/SCP backend has had an overhaul.  It now requires the
python-pexpect module.  Normally this can be obtained from your
distro's repository, but if you want, you can download pexpect
from http://pexpect.sourceforge.net.

The SSH/SCP backend work was done to allow the user to use password
authentication rather than public-key.  You may now enter a password,
either through the FTP_PASSWORD environment variable, or at the
console.  To activate this feature you will need to use the option
--ssh-askpass on the command line.  The default is public-key, which
does *not* look for a password from either source.

Various fixes to the man page for --ssh-askpass, --remove-older-than,
and --archive-dir.


New in v0.4.3.RC10 (2007/07/14)
-------------------------------
Add support for:
  --ftp-passive,
  --ftp-regular

Removed -m option on FTP put command.  This means that the remote
directory must exist prior to backup.

Changed ftpBackend from -f option back to commandline.  Various
versions of ncftp* interact differently when both -f and commandline
options are supplied.

The FTP password is munged in all log operations.

Added logging of filenames in the bucket when -v9 is used on
Amazon S3.


New in v0.4.3.RC9 (2007/07/09)
------------------------------
Change to a max block size of 2048 bytes for rsync difference buffer.
This may slow things down for truly large files, but will give much
smaller deltas on files with numerous small changes, such as database
files.

New S3 backend, Boto, from Eric Evans, replaces bitBucket.  Boto can
be obtained from http://code.google.com/p/boto/.  I did not make this
a requirement for setup since its not in the normal repositories.

New FTP backend from Thorsten Schnebeck that uses ncftp instead of
Pythons ftplib.  This seems to be much more solid.  I added the -f
option with a secure temp file to contain host, user, and password,
rather than having them on the command line.  I also added the -m
option to the put command to create the target directory and the -t
option to make sure it times out if there is a network problem.

The Backend class now contains a popen_persist function that acts like
run_command_persist.  Both use the new num_retries global.

Added a commandline option, '--num-retries=<int>', to set the number
of retries.  The default is 5.


New in v0.4.3.RC8 (2007/06/27)
------------------------------
Bug 20282 - Thomas Tuttle:
An out of range index when checking past history in the backup
sets caused a failure when trying to access later.

Bug 20149 - dAniel hAhler:
dAniel submitted a second patch for this for further cleanup.
The new patch prefers the latest intact backup set.

Bug 20039 - Andreas Schildbach: --and--
Patch 6030 - Alexander Zangerl <az@debian.org>:
Duplicity now uses bzip2 for compression.  This matches the way
the Debian distribution handles it.  I'll think about adding an
option to override later, if its needed.


New in v0.4.3.RC7 (2007/06/19)
------------------------------
Bug 20179 - dAniel hAhler:
When errors cause login to fail in FTP, reset and try again.

Patch 6015 -dAniel hAhler:
Better display of traceback when ftpBackend errors out.

Patch 6029 - Alexander Zangerl <az@debian.org>:
http://bugs.debian.org/370206
archive-dir together with incremental backup results in crash. the
patch is simple, the code in 0.4.2 did attempt to access strings as
objects.

Patch 6031 - Alexander Zangerl <az@debian.org>:
http://bugs.debian.org/369971
there's some problems with unattended encrypted dumps, if the user
doesn't want to hand duplicity the gpg passphrase and attempts to work
around this by using a local archive dir.  the patch makes it look at
a manifest in a local archive dir if gpg doesn't manage to decrypt a
remote one (no surprise without a passphrase).

Patch 6032 - Alexander Zangerl <az@debian.org>:
a new feature patch: i've recently gotten annoyed with having
gazillions of 5mb files and therefore added a --volsize option to
allow the user setting the chunk size. the patch is simple and
contains a manpage update as well.

Patch 6033 - Alexander Zangerl <az@debian.org>:
let's add a --help terse usage message and don't just direct the user
to the manual. this should come handy if somebody needs to restore
stuff without having the manual available.


New in v0.4.3.RC6 (2007/06/13)
------------------------------
Bug 20149 - dAniel hAhler: When errors cause an incomplete backup set,
flag the error with a message, rather than erroring out.  The user
then knows to run --cleanup.

Patch 5998 - Kuang-che Wu: Cache uid and gid lookup to speed
operations.

Patch 5993 - daacyy302@sneakemail.com: Make Amazon S3 backend
incrementally more robust for recovery.


New in v0.4.3.RC5 (2007/06/04)
------------------------------
GnuPG fails when trying to access stdin on an empty passphrase.
Changes allow empty passphrase on public-key encryption and now
respond gracefully on empty passphrase for symmetric encryption.

dAniel hAhler submitted a patch to change "Error initializing file
foo" (log level 2), where foo was a socket, to "Skipping socket foo"
(log level 7).  https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?5985

Change logging to flush after every write, unbuffering stdout and
stderr, thus producing logs that are coherent.


New in v0.4.3.RC4 (2007/06/02)
------------------------------
More fixes on FTP.  dAniel hAhler supplied a new patch for FTP that
cleans up the error handling and reduces the retry time to zero on the
first retry.


New in v0.4.3.RC3 (2007/05/31)
------------------------------
Fixed connection problem in FTP where it was not quitting on
connection reset and just logging in again.  This created many stale
logins on the remote system.

Changed attribution of a couple of patches to dAniel hAhler, who
actually wrote the patches, not just found them.


New in v0.4.3.RC2 (2007/05/30)
------------------------------
Fixed bug in tarfile.py that was causing ValueError exception.  Thanks
to dAniel hAhler for the patch that fixed the problem.  Refer to:
http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?19998

  https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?16711

ProFTPD resets the connection after returning 226 when NLSTing an
empty directory, so changed code to allow that exception.

ftpBackend now asks for a password if FTP_PASSWORD does not exist.

rsyncBackend was using full URL in the commandline and failing.
It now uses only server:path/, leaving off rsync://.

Added --sftp-command option, now that the scp backend uses sftp for
listing and deleting files.

Brian Sutherland has contributed a new backend for Amazon's S3 data
storage service.

Added some patches compiled by Andre Beckedorf:

    Tolerate more errors when listing an ftp directory (errors
    indicate an empty dir).

    Retry ftp commands when upon temporary error.  (Thanks to to
    Stefan Schimanski and dAniel hAhler for their patches.)


New in v0.4.2 (2006/02/02)
--------------------------
Mathias de Riese's substantial patch or patches appear to have been
applied to CVS years ago, but not released yet.  Sorry about that.

Followed suggestion by David Rigel, make user type passphrase twice to
confirm.

Eric Hanchrow's patch makes sure duplicity deletes older signatures
when using --remove-older-than.

Jiri Tyr's patch may fix some scp/sftp problems.

asdf's patch makes sure uids or gids over 2097151 don't corrupt the
tarfiles.

Cleaned up and documented --collection-status option, which lists the
backup chains and sets found in the repository.

FTP error 450 when listing a directory now understood to mean the
directory is empty (duplicity will not exit with error).

--remove-older-than now cannot delete the active backup chain, even if
you specify a time later than the chain (e.g. "--remove-older-than
now").


New in v0.4.1 (2003/08/09)
--------------------------
Applied (version of) Helmut Schneider's patch to display file mod
times with --list-current-files.

Fixed bug found by Rob Browning handling symlinks with long names that
have long names.

Applied Stephen Isard's patch to fix exclude-globbing-filelist.

Applied Sebastian Wilhelmi's patches to add rsync as a backend.

To improve large file performance, signature block size is now based
on file length.

duplicity should now build with librsync 0.9.6.  Much thanks to
Donovan Baarda for his work in this version of librsync.

duplicity should work with Python 2.3 now.


New in v0.4.0 (2002/11/30)
--------------------------
Changed restore procedure to download volumes from all backup sets
simultaneously.

Changed the verbosity level of some messages to 5, so level 4 is
cleaner.

Added --verify option, for checking whether a backup is up-to-date, or
to see what has changed since that backup.

GPG no longer needed: with --no-encryption option duplicity will write
gzipped volumes.  The checksums of volumes will still be verified, but
this will not stop a malicious attack because the manifest files can
be easily updated.

Earlier versions could crash when doing an incremental backup where no
files had changed.


New in v0.3.1 (2002/11/17)
--------------------------
Now by default the most recent files get restored, not the oldest.
You can get the old weird behavior by specifying --restore-time 1 (or
any other very early time).

Fixed a couple bugs where duplicity would crash if it found the remote
directory corrupted in various ways (for instance, if it contained a
file that looked like a duplicity file but had an invalid time
string).

Added --cleanup option, for deleting the files that may accumulate if
a duplicity session is aborted after it has uploaded some files.

Added --remove-older-than option, for safely deleting backup sets
older than the given time.

Suppress GPG log messages like "gpg: CAST5 encrypted data" if
verbosity is set to 3 or less.

short-filenames get even shorter---now use base 36 (0-9 and a-z) for
times and volume numbers.  This change is not backwards compatible but
probably I'm the only one affected.  If not, let me know and I can
probably write a little script.

Improved the way files are packed into the volumes so less space is
wasted per volume.

Decreased default volume size to 5MB (from 50MB) in preparation for
the new restore system planned for 0.4.0.


New in v0.3.0 (2002/11/10)
--------------------------
Added ftp backend.  Now the remote repository can accessed by ftp and
can be specified like "ftp://user@foo.bar/".

Added --ssh-command and --scp-command options, which can be used to
replace ssh and scp, or pass different arguments to them.  Requested
by Will Dyson.

Added --short-filenames option, for use when uploading to a file
system that can't have filenames longer than 30 characters (e.g. Mac
OS 8).

Added --list-current-files mode, which lists the files currently at
the given destination url.

Ported some statistics code from rdiff-backup.  Now by default
statistics are printed after a backup session.  This can be disabled
with the --no-print-statistics option.  Thanks to Mathieu Doidy for
requesting the above two features.

Added rdiff-backup-style --include/exclude-filelist-globbing options.
Now filelists with "+ /- " can be treated exactly like repeated
--include or --exclude options.

Fixed bug backing up normal files instead of directories.  Thanks to
Mathieu Doidy for bug report.


New in v0.2.1 (2002/10/31)
--------------------------
Security Fix:  Fixed bug where an rdiffdir patch containing a path
with a '..' component could overwrite files in parent directory.

Fixed bug where files without a username (only uid) would be marked as
changed every session.  Thanks to Peter Ehrenberg for bug report.

Now files with negative mtimes are treated as if they have mtime 0.
This prevents them from being marked as changed unnecessarily.  Thanks
to Peter Ehrenberg for report.


New in v0.2.0 (2002/09/29)
--------------------------
(Thanks to Peter Ehrenberg for his valuable suggestions on many of the
below.)

** IMPORTANT ** New syntax intended to make duplicity more
user-friendly.  Old duplicity invocation will not work so change your
scripts and read the man page.

By default no local archive dir will be read or created.
$HOME/.duplicity has no special significance.  However, one can be
specified with --archive-dir for faster operation.

If PASSPHRASE environment variable not set, ask user for passphrase
instead of exiting.

The source directory and hostname are now recorded, and rdiff-backup
will complain if you try to back up different directories to the same
location (but --allow-source-mismatch can override).

Changed some of the logging verbosity levels.  Level 5 now lists files
being backed up.

Fixed large file problems.  Files larger than 2GB should be backed up
correctly.

Significant additions to the manual page.

By default, duplicity now chooses whether to make a full or
incremental backup depending on whether up-to-date signatures can be
found on the remote side or local archive directory.  Overrideable
with (-f/--full and -i/--incremental).


New in v0.1.1 (2002/09/16)
--------------------------
Supports asymmetric encryption with GPG public keys using the
--encrypt-key option.

Added option --sign-key.  When backing up, files are signed with the
given key.  When restoring, remote files are required to be signed by
given key.

Now duplicity checks the hash data found in the manifest file.  The
previous version generated SHA1 hashes but did not check them when
restoring.

Fixed GnuPG broken pipe error.  In the previous version certain
partial restores would end with a spurious GnuPG error message.


New in v0.1.0 (2002/08/26)
--------------------------
First real version.
