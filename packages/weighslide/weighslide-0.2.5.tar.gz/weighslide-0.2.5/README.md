# Weighslide  
  
Weighslide is a python program to calculate sliding windows across of a list of numerical values.  
The user sets the window size, and the exact weighting of each value in the window.
  
## What is it used for?
Weighslide was developed for use in bioinformatics. Alpha-helices are common protein secondary structure, and have
a periodicity of 3.6 residues per turn. Weighslide allows numerical values to be weighted according to alpha-helical peridicity.

Note that weighslide is not currently optimised for large datasets.

# How it works  
Weighslide takes as an input a 1D array (list) of numerical data, and applies a user-defined weighting and algorithm in a sliding-window fashion across the data.  
      
```  
For example:  
window = [ 2  5  2 ]  
statistic = "mean"  
dataset = [ 0  0  0  1  1  2  3  5  8  13  21]  
The window length is 3. The array will therefore be sliced as follows:  
........[ NaN  0  0 ]  
.............[ 0  0  1 ]  
................[ 0  1  1 ]  
...................[ 1  1  2 ] and so on until the final slice [ 13  21  NaN ]  
Each array slice will be "weighted" by multiplication with the window, array-style, resulting in:  
........[ NaN  0  0 ]  
.............[ 0  0  2 ]  
................[ 0  5  2 ]  
...................[ 2  5  4 ] and so on.  
If the "statistic" variable is given as "mean", a mean will be calculated for each array slice.  
..........[    0    ]  
.............[   0.66  ]  
................[   2.33  ]  
...................[  3.66  ] and so on.  
The "statistic" can be mean, std, or sum.  
The value (in this case the mean) will replace the central position in the output 1D array.  
output = [ 0.00  0.00  0.66  2.33  3.66  6.00  9.66  15.6  25.3  41.0  65.5  ]  
```  
  
The first and last array slices always contain flanking "not a number" (Nan) values, which are ignored in all calculations.  
The first and last output values therefore do not represent results from true, full-length windows.  
  
# Installation

`pip install weighslide`  

Weighslide depends on the following:  
* python (tested for version 3.5)  
* numpy  
* pandas  
* matplotlib  
  
For Windows users, we recommend Anaconda python 3.x. The Anaconda package should contain all required python packages.  
  
To install as a python package from GitHub, download and unzip the latest release and run `python setup.py install` in the relevant package folder.
  
# Test  
To test the package, open the command console and navigate to the folder  
containing weighslide.py. Run the following:  
  
`python weighslide.py [1,1,"x",1,1] mean -r [1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34]`  
  
If successful, an output list will be printed on the screen.  
  
# Usage  
Here is an example of how to run weighslide within python, using an excel input file.  
```  
import weighslide  
infile = r"D:\Path\To\Your\File\infile_name.xlsx"  
# for excel files, you will need to input the sheet name containing the data  
excel_kwargs = {"sheet_name":"Sheet1"}  
# if it's an excel file with multiple columns, define which column contains the data  
column = "your data column header"  
# define the window and statistic. The following parameters are used  
# if you want to calculate mean of the four surrounding values in the sequence  
window = [1,1,"x",1,1]  
statistic = "mean"  
name = "your short sample name"  
weighslide.run_weighslide(infile, window, statistic, name=name, column=column, excel_kwargs=excel_kwargs)  
```  
  
Here is an example of how to run weighslide from the command line, using a csv input file.  
```  
python weighslide.py [1,1,'x',1,1] mean -i "D:\Path\To\Your\File\infile_name.xlsx" -c "your data column header"  
```  
In both cases the output files will be created in a subfolder within the same location as the input file.  
  
For more help regarding the command-line options:  
`python weighslide.py -h`  
  
Here is an example designed for jupyter notebook, showing the power of weighslide  
to smoothen a repeated element in a noisy dataset.  
```  
# create a noisy wave that repeats every 6th position. Save to csv.  
import weighslide  
import numpy as np  
import pandas as pd  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
% matplotlib inline  
plt.rcParams["savefig.dpi"] = 120  
df = pd.DataFrame()  
df['wave'] = [1,1,1,3,3,3]*8  
df["random"] = np.random.random_sample(df.shape[0])  
df["noisy wave"] = df.wave + df.random*5  
df.plot(title="input data: noisy wave")  
df.to_csv("wave.csv")  
```

```  
# run weighslide with a window that averages every 6th position  
window = "9xxxxx9xxxxx9xxxxx9xxxxx9xxxxx9xxxxx9"  
weighslide.run_weighslide("wave.csv", window, "mean", name="wavetest", column="noisy wave", overwrite=True)  
```

**Examples of windows:**  
  
[1,1,1]  
* if "statistic" is set to "mean", this window returns the average of the central position, and the two neighbouring positions  
* the window size is 3  
  
[1,1,"x",1,1]  
* the central position "x" has no weighting at all  
* the window size is 5, it consists of the central position, two upstream, and two downstream positions  
* the positions upstream (-1, -2) and downstream (1, 2) of the central position are all equally weighted  
* if the statistic is set to "mean", the result for each position will simply be the average of the surrounding 4 positions  
  
[0.5, 1, 0.5, 2, 0.5, 1, 0.5]  
* the central position "2" is highly weighted (2*orig value)  
* the window size is 7, it consists of the central position, three upstream, and three downstream positions  
* the positions upstream (-1, -2, -3) and downstream (1, 2, 3) of the central position are unequally weighted  
* if the statistic is set to "mean", the result for each position will simply be the average of the surrounding 4 positions
