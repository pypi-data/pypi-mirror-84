.. _whatsnew-4.2-time-perf-imp:

Time performance improvements
=============================

The performance for creating a ``Time`` object from a large array of
fixed-format string times was dramatically improved. For ISO and ISOT formats
the speed-up is a factor of 25 and for the year day-of-year format the speedup
is a factor of 50. This is done with a new C-based time string parser which can
also be used for custom user-defined Time formats. For details see
:ref:`time-fast-c-parser`.

In addition the performance for creating a scalar ``Time`` object in a epoch
format like ``unix``, ``unix_tai``, or ``cxcsec`` was improved by a factor of 4.
