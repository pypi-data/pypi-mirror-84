py_rankaggregation
==================

This project seeks to build a Python software package to aggregate a collection of 
ranked lists using various aggregation approaches.
The goal of rank aggregation is to come up with a single ranked list of objects 
in the original lists such that the final ranking reflects some aggregate measure 
of the items' ranks in the individual lists of the original collection.
This package covers a variety of aggregation methods and works with different 
representations of ranked lists. 
It is built to serve as a one-stop-shop for ranked list aggregation in Python.

The package is free, open-source, and BSD-licensed.

Dependencies
============

The required dependencies to build the packages are:

* numpy (provides advanced array and list operations)
* scipy (provides advanced statistical analysis tools)
* pandas (provides data structures to store and manage tables)
* scikit-learn (provides implementations for common machine learning algorithms)
* six (provides functions to write compatible code across Python 2 and 3)

Platforms
=========

py_rankaggregation has been tested on Linux, OS X and Windows.
