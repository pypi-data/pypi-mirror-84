Usage
=====

To use inicheck in a project you will need to create a master config file for
all your configuration files to be checked against. To get started with writing
a master configuration file see :ref:`MasterConfig`.

Command Line
============

A First Use Example:
--------------------

Once the Master file is created, create a config file and check it! Consider
the following example. Lets say the Master Configuration file contains
one section and one recipe like:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/simple/master.ini

To make a simple configuration file we need to create the file and fill out
whatever entries are important to the specific user:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/simple/config.ini

Now to check what the user just entered into their config:

.. code-block:: console

  inicheck -f config.ini -c master.ini

If you do not get any errors then you have just checked your first config file!

To see how inicheck interpreted your config file add the -w option to the aboved
command. This will output the file the way inicheck sees it. Opening it up will
show all the entries are filled out.

For more info see :ref:`CLI`.

Aiming to be User Proof
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For a further demo, let's say the our user think themselves funny and enters the
following into their configuration file:

.. code-block:: console

    age: nunya!
    job_class: king

inicheck will produce errors and report them in the following manner:

.. code-block:: console

      Configuration File Status Report:
      ==========================================================================
      ERRORS:

      Section              Item          Message
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------
      settings             age                Expecting int received str
      settings             job_class          Not a valid option

This takes alot of issues out of the hands of the developer so they can focus
more on functionality rather than the sometimes erratic behavior of users.

For information take a look at :ref:`CLI`.

For a Project
===========================

Using inicheck for your project is a great way to save on repeated code and
reduce insane amounts of check of types, whether something exists, etc...

Getting a Config File
---------------------
Once the user has filled out a configuration file, inicheck can bring in the
information via a :class:`~inicheck.config.UserConfig` object by using the
following at a minimum:

.. code-block:: python

  from inicheck.tools import get_user_config

  ucfg = get_user_config(filename, module=str_module_name, checking_later=True)


**CAUTION**: Using the *checking later* flag will allow inicheck to pass over issues
that would raise exceptions so that the developer can inform the user of the
issues with their config file at the same time. This can be dangerous if the
developer does not follow  up with the functions check_config and
print_config_report.

To get the config and check it and report the warnings and errors to the screen:

.. code-block:: python

  from inicheck.tools import get_user_config, check_config, print_config_report

  ucfg = get_user_config(filename, module=str_module_name, checking_later=True)
  warnings, errors = check_config(ucfg)
  print_config_report(warnings, errors)

To learn more see checkout the functions documentation:
  * :func:`~inicheck.tools.get_user_config`
  * :func:`~inicheck.tools.check_config`
  * :func:`~inicheck.output.print_config_report`

Installing a Master Configuration File
--------------------------------------

Once you have made a master configuration file, the easiest way to use it for your own
project is to add its file path as a module attribute. inicheck currently looks
for attributes when a module is requested:

  * __core_config__
  * __recipes__

If both are found inicheck will combine them and create a large master configuration
file. Below is an example of how to add these attributes to your module.

.. code-block:: python

  # Add the following to the packages's __init__.py file
  import os
  __core_config__ = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__) + '/master.ini')

  # If you have enough recipes to keep the files separate you can add:
  __recipes__ = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__) + '/recipes.ini')

Once this is done make sure you add the file(s) to whatever package inclusions
you need. Here is an example of how to include them in your setup.py

.. code-block:: python

  # In a setup.py, under the setup class initializer
  package_data={'mymodule':['./master.ini',
                      './recipes.ini']},

Custom Configuration File Headers
---------------------------------

inicheck has multiple ways to output your configuration file once inicheck as
interpreted it. It is nice to use these because they are clean and it often
serves as a placemark on some settings used for some event/task.
Developers can provide custom headers. We have seen this functionality used for:

* Datetime stamping configuration file creation
* Marking with relevant software version numbers or git hashes.
* Links to source code or documentation

To add this to your project, simply add:

.. code-block:: python

  __config_header__ = some.function()

where "some.function()" would be a custom function that returns a string of content
to write to the top of you configuration file.

Here are some examples of this in action:

* `SMRFs example configuration header`_
* `SMRFs example custom header function`_
.. _`SMRFs example configuration header`: https://github.com/USDA-ARS-NWRC/smrf/blob/master/examples/boise_river_basin/brb_wy2017.ini
.. _`SMRFs example custom header function`: https://github.com/USDA-ARS-NWRC/smrf/blob/master/smrf/utils/utils.py#L259


Custom Configuration File Section Titles
-----------------------------------------

A less critical feature but still nice for producing self describing
configuration files is having custom section headers.

To add this to your project, simply add the following attribute with a
dictionary containing corresponding sections with the messages desired:

.. code-block:: python

  __config_titles__ = {"Setup": "This is the setup section"}

The result is a config file with a section preceeded by:

.. code-block:: ini

  #######################################################################
  # This Is The Setup Section
  #######################################################################

  [setup]
  # configuration stuff..

The following is a good example of how this looks in a project:

* `AWSMs example configuration titles`_
* `AWSMS module dictionary`_
