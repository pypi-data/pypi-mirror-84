# mkapi-fix

A fork of mkapi with a couple of _fixes_ that fit my use

Note that those _fixes_ may not make sense for your case

## Install
```bash
pip install mkapi-fix
# make sure you only have mkapi or mkapi-fix installed
```

## Fixes

- Fix when module prefix is None
- Skip `__wrapped__` check if errored
