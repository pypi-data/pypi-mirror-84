v4.0.1
======

- Refreshed package metadata.

v4.0.0
======

- Removed ``strptime`` function in favor of
  `datetime.datetime.strptime <https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime>`_. If passing
  a ``tzinfo`` parameter, instead invoke `.replace(tzinfo=...)`
  on the result.
- Deprecated ``divide_timedelta`` and ``divide_timedelta_float``
  now that Python supports this functionality natively.
- Deprecated ``Parser`` class. The
  `dateutil.parser <https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/parser.html>`_
  provides more sophistication.

v3.0.0
======

- #10: ``strftime`` now reverts to the stdlib behavior for
  ``%u``. Use tempora 2.1 or later and the ``%µ`` for
  microseconds.

v2.1.1
======

- #8: Fixed error in ``PeriodicCommandFixedDelay.daily_at``
  when timezone is more than 12 hours from UTC.

v2.1.0
======

- #9: Fixed error when date object is passed to ``strftime``.
- #11: ``strftime`` now honors upstream expectation of
  rendering date values on time objects and vice versa.
- #10: ``strftime`` now honors ``%µ`` for rendering just
  the "microseconds" as ``%u`` supported previously.
  In a future, backward-incompatible release, the
  ``%u`` behavior will revert to the behavior as found
  in stdlib.

v2.0.0
======

* Require Python 3.6 or later.
* Removed DatetimeConstructor.

1.14.1
======

#7: Fix failing doctest in ``parse_timedelta``.

    changes.
