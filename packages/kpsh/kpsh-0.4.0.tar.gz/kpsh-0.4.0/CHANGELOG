kpsh (0.4.0)

    Wayland: XDG_SESSION_TYPE environment variable).
  * autotype: added --backend flag to force using xdotool or ydotool
  * autotype: From now on xdotool and ydotool are searched in PATH instead of
    being run by a hardcoded absolute path.

kpsh (0.3)

  * BREAKING: kpsh-menu: now it operates only with kpsh in daemon mode (see
    below)
  * KPSH can work as a daemon which can communicate with client processes via a
    simple socket-based text protocol. It is enabled by running kpsh -d.
  * Added kpsh-client script to contrib. It implements a command-line client to
    KPSH daemon mode.
  * New command: db to query which database is opened.
  * Watch database for changes and reload if needed
  * BUGFIX: Passing to xdotool (autotype) strings which start with a hyphen, 
    which were interpreted by xdotool as switches instead of literal strings
  * BUGFIX: Fixed a crash when trying to query unopened database via socket
  * BUGFIX: Fixed not resetting password when database is opened simultaneously.
