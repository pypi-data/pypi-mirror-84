/**
    A struct of paramers used to create a new context with `TCOD_context_new`.

    `tcod_version` should always be set to the constant: `TCOD_COMPILEDVERSION`.

    `x` and `y` is the starting position of the window.  These are SDL
    parameters so values like `SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED` and
    `SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED` are acceptable.
    If unsure then use `SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED` for both, even when you don't
    desire a window.

    `pixel_width` and `pixel_height` are the desired size of the window in
    pixels.
    If these are zero then they'll be derived from `columns`, `rows`, and the
    `tileset`.

    `columns` and `rows` are the desired size of the terminal window.
    Usually you'll set either these or the pixel resolution.

    `renderer_type` is a `TCOD_renderer_t` type.

    `tileset` is an optional pointer to a tileset object.
    If this is NULL then a platform specific fallback tileset will be used.
    This fallback is known to be unreliable, but it should work well enough for
    prototyping code.

    If `vsync` is true, then vertical sync will be enabled whenever possible.
    A value of true is recommended.

    `sdl_window_flags` is a bitfield of SDL_WindowFlags flags.
    For a window, a value of ``SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE`` is recommended.
    For fullscreen, a value of
    ``SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE | SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP`` is recommended.
    You should avoid the ``SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN`` flag whenever possible.

    `window_title` will be the title of the opened window.

    `argc` and `argv` are optional CLI parameters.
    You can pass `0` and `NULL` respectfully to ignore them.
    If unsure then you should pass the `argc` and `argv` arguments from your
    `main` function.

    If user attention is required for the given CLI parameters then
    `cli_output` will be called with `cli_userdata` and an error or help
    message.
    If `cli_output` is NULL then it will print the message to stdout and
    terminate the program.  If `cli_output` returns normally then
    TCOD_E_REQUIRES_ATTENTION will be returned from `TCOD_context_new`.
