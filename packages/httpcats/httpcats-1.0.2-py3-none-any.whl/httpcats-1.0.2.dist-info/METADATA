# httpcats
Getting URLs to your favourite HTTP Cats made easy!


### Installation

Installing `httpcats` is easy, just run `pip install httpcats`!

### Usage

I've developed `httpcats` to make using HTTP Cats simple and fun.

Currently, you can get your cats using one of two functions - `cat_by_name` and `cat_by_code`

`cat_by_name(name: str)` takes in a sole parameter - `name`, which is the status code name to get a cat for.
Upon finding a cat matching the name, it returns an `HTTPCat` object. Here's an example -

```
from httpcats import cat_by_name

my_cat = cat_by_name("Success")

print(f"My cat has a code of {my_cat.code} and means {my_cat.name}! The URL is {my_cat.url}")
# Prints - 
# My cat has a code of 200 and means Success! The URL is https://http.cat/200
```

`cat_by_code(code: int)` is extremely similar to `cat_by_name`, just using a status code value.
Upon finding a cat matching the name, it returns an `HTTPCat` object. Here's an example -

```
from httpcats import cat_by_code

my_cat = cat_by_code(404)

print(f"My cat has a code of {my_cat.code} and means {my_cat.name} :( The URL is {my_cat.url}")
# Prints - 
# My cat has a code of 404 and means Not Found :( The URL is https://http.cat/404
```
