        Magic to simplify working with durable.rules in educational contexts, initially when working with "subject, predicate, object" triple style reasoning.
        
        Install as:
        
        `pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/innovationOUtside/durable_rules_magic.git`
        
        See the `demo.ipynb` for usage.
        
        
        ## Additional Notes
        
        If we define:
        
        ```python
        from IPython.display import Javascript
        
        class Speech():
            def say(self, txt):
                display(Javascript(f'speechSynthesis.speak(new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("{txt}"))'))
        ```
        
        then we can get Python to speak...
        
        For example:
        
        ```python
        speaker = Speech()
        speaker.say('hello')
        ```
        
        This means we can hear the reasoning using rules of the form:
        
        ```python
           @when_all(Subject('eats', 'worms'))
            def bird(c):
                speaker.say(f'if {c.m.subject} eats worms')
                Set(c, '? : is : bird')
                speaker.say(f'{c.m.subject} is a bird')
        ```
        
        which would make the rules both accessible and easier to follow.
        
        Could we perhaps create a decorator to the rules that would provide such spoken annotations?
