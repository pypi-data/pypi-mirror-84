===========================
libnacl 1.5.0 Release Notes
===========================

Add Built In libsodium.so Support
=================================

Added the ability to place a `libsodium.so` file in the libnacl
python directory as a last resort fallback. To use this feature
just copy your `libsodium.so` file to the same directory as the libnacl
`__init__.py` file.

This was added to make total portability of the library easier.

Add `bytes_eq`
==============

Added the `bytes_eq` function to allow better byte comparison
