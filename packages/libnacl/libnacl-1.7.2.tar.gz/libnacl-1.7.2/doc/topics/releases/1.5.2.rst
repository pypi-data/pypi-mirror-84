libnacl 1.5.2 Release Notes
===========================

Add Support for AEAD AES and chacha20poly1305
=============================================

Big thanks to Nicholas O'Brien for adding support for libsodium's AEAD
encryption systems. The raw functions are all available to access
libsodium directly along with the high level AEAD class that cleanly
follows libnacl's key management model.
