libnacl 1.5.1 Release Notes
===========================

Add Sealed Box Support
======================

A big thanks to Manatsawin Hanmongkolchai for adding in support for libsodium
`Sealed Boxes`!

Change Exception on Encrypt/Decrypt Failure
===========================================

If encryption or decryption fails, `CryptError` is raised instead of
`ValueError`. This might be a breaking change for your application. See
`#91 <https://github.com/saltstack/libnacl/issues/91>`__ and
`#74 <https://github.com/saltstack/libnacl/issues/74>`__.
