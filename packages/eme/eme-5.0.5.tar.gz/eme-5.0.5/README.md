Python web framework built on flask.

## Documentation

## Features

- Website
- Websocket server
- Autotests
- Timed Tasks and OS event tasks
- Command Line Interface
- ...And whatever else you can think of!

All for the same project! All with the same programming interface! All completely decoupled from each other.
Let's see any web framework doing that.

Also EME does not care about how you deal with your business logic, data access layer or frontend. All of that is completely up to the developer to handle in whatever architecture and using whatever modules they like.

- flask
- flask_login
