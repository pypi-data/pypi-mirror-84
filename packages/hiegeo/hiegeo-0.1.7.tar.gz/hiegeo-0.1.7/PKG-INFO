Description: README
        ===================
        
        This is the README file for the Python module ``hiegeo``, described in
        the manuscript *A new perspective to model subsurface stratigraphy in
        alluvial hydrogeological basins, introducing geological hierarchy and
        relative chronology* by C.Zuffetti, A.Comunian, R.Bersezio and
        P.Renard, Computers and Geosciences, DOI: `10.1016/j.cageo.2020.104506 <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2020.104506>`_.
        
        Hereinafter we report a brief "quick start guide".  For additional
        information about how to install and run the provided Python scripts,
        please check out the full documentation from `this link
        <https://hiegeo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ can be also
        downloaded as PDF, EPUB and also as a local HTML archive `here
        <https://readthedocs.org/projects/hiegeo/downloads/>`_.
        
        
        Installation
        =========================
        
        ``hiegeo`` is available at the `Python Package Index repository
        <https://pypi.org/project/hiegeo/>`_. Therefore, in can be easily
        installed (together with its dependencies) with the command::
        
            pip install hiegeo
        
        Alternatively, if you prefer to download the sources from
        `https://bitbucket.org/alecomunian/hiegeo
        <https://bitbucket.org/alecomunian/hiegeo>`_ in "edit mode" you can:
        
        1) Clone or download this repository on your hard drive.
        2) If required, unpack it and ``cd hiegeo``.
        3) Inside the project directory, from the command line::
        
             pip install -e .
        
        4) To check if it worked, open a Python terminal and try::
        
             import hiegeo
        
        Examples
        ==============================
        
        To test the package, move to the folder ``examples`` and there, from
        the command line, run one of the two provided demonstration scripts.
        For example::
        
          ./hiegeo_test-simple.py
        
        and hit <Enter>.
        On Linux you will probably need to give execution rights to the file, like this::
        
          chmod +x hiegeo_test-simple.py
