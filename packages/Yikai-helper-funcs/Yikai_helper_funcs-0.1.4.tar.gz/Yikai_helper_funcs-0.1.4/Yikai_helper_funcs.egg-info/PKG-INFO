        ## Install
        
        `pip install your_project_name`
        
        ## How to use
        
        Since currently the functions are still being added and there are not many of them, the most convenient way is to simply `from Yikai_helper_funcs.core import * `.  This would give you all of the functions defined within the package. The names are carefully chosen thus they should not collide with your namespace.
