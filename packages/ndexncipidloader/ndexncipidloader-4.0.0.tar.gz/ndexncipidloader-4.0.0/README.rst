Python application that loads NCI-PID data into NDEx_

This tool downloads OWL_ files containing NCI-PID data from: ftp://ftp.ndexbio.org/NCI_PID_BIOPAX_2016-06-08-PC2v8-API/
and performs the following operations:

**1\)** OWL files are converted to extended SIF_ format using Paxtools_ and the SIF_ file is loaded into a network

**2\)** A node attribute named **type** is added to each node and is set to one of the following
   by extracting its value from **PARTICIPANT_TYPE** column in SIF_ file:

* **protein** (originally ProteinReference)

* **smallmolecule** (originally SmallMoleculeReference)

* **proteinfamily** (set if node name has **family** and was a **protein**)

* **RnaReference** (original value)

* **ProteinReference;SmallMoleculeReference** (original value)

**3\)** A node attribute named **alias** is added to each node and is loaded from **UNIFICATION_XREF**
column in SIF_ file which is split by `;` into a list. Each element of this list is prefixed with **uniprot:** and t first element is set as the
**represents** value in node and removed from the **alias** attribute. If after
removal, the **alias** attribute value is empty, it is removed.

**4\)** In SIF_ file **INTERACTION_TYPE** defines edge interaction type and **INTERACTION_PUBMED_ID** define
value of **citation** edge attribute. The values in **citation** edge attribute are
prefixed with **pubmed:** Once loaded redundant edges are removed
following these conventions:

* **neighbor-of** edges are removed

* **controls-state-of** edges are removed if another edge connecting same nodes has one of the following interactions: **controls-state-change-of, controls-transport-of, controls-phosphorylation-of, controls-expression-of**

**NOTE:** If above results in orphaned nodes, those nodes are removed as well

**5\)** An edge attribute named **directed** is set to **True** if edge interaction type is one of the following (otherwise its set to **False**)

.. code-block::

    controls-state-change-of
    controls-transport-of
    controls-phosphorylation-of
    controls-expression-of
    catalysis-precedes
    controls-production-of
    controls-transport-of-chemical
    chemical-affects
    used-to-produce

**6\)** If node name matches **represents** value in node (with **uniprot:** prefix added) then the node name is replaced with gene symbol from `gene_symbol_mapping.json`_

**7\)** If node name starts with **CHEBI** then node name is replaced with value of **PARTICIPANT_NAME** from SIF_ column

**8\)** If node **represents** value starts with **chebi:CHEBI** the **chebi:** is removed

**9\)** If **_HUMAN** in SIF_ file **PARTICIPANT_NAME** column for a given node then this value is replaced by doing a lookup in `gene_symbol_mapping.json`_, unless value in lookup is **-** in which case original name is left

**10\)** Any node with **family** node name is changed as follows if a lookup of node name against **gene_symbol_mapping.json** returns one or more genes

* Node attribute named **member** is added and set to list of genes found in lookup in `gene_symbol_mapping.json`_
* Node attribute named **type** is changed to **proteinfamily**

**11\)** The following network attributes are set

* **name** set to name of OWL_ file with **.owl.gz** suffix removed except for **PathwayCommons.8.NCI_PID.BIOPAX** which is renamed to **NCI PID - Complete Interactions**
* **author** (from **Curated By** column in `networkattributes.tsv`_)
* **labels** (from **PID** column in `networkattributes.tsv`_)
* **organism** is pulled from **organism** attribute of `style.cx`_
* **prov:wasGeneratedBy** is set to html link to this repo with text ndexncipidloader <VERSION> (example: ndexncipidloader 1.2.0)
* **prov:wasDerivedFrom** is set to full path to OWL_ file on ftp site
* **reviewers** (from **Reviewed By** column in `networkattributes.tsv`_)
* **version** is set to Abbreviated month-year (example: MAY-2019)
* **description** is pulled from **description** attribute of `style.cx`_ except for **NCI PID - Complete Interactions** which has a hardcoded description set to `This network includes all interactions of the individual NCI-PID pathways.`
* **networkType** is set to list of string with single entry **pathway** except for **NCI PID - Complete Interactions** which also includes **interactome**
* **__iconurl** is set to value of `--iconurl` flag (currently defaulting to http://search.ndexbio.org/static/media/ndex-logo.04d7bf44.svg)
* **__normalizationversion** is set to 0.1

**12\)** By default each network is made public with full indexed and showcased (visible in user's home network list page)

Dependencies
------------

* `ndex2 <https://pypi.org/project/ndex2>`_
* `ndexutil <https://pypi.org/project/ndexutil>`_
* `biothings_client <https://pypi.org/project/biothings-client>`_
* `requests <https://pypi.org/project/requests>`_
* `pandas <https://pypi.org/project/pandas>`_
* `py4cytoscape <https://pypi.org/project/py4cytoscape>`_


Compatibility
-------------

* Python 3.6+

Installation
------------

.. code-block::

   git clone https://github.com/ndexcontent/ndexncipidloader
   cd ndexncipidloader
   make dist
   pip install dist/ndexncipidloader*whl


Configuration
-------------

The **ndexloadncipid.py** requires a configuration file in the following format be created.
The default path for this configuration is :code:`~/.ndexutils.conf` but can be overridden with
:code:`--conf` flag.

**Format of configuration file**

.. code-block::

    [<value in --profile (default ndexncipidloader)>]

    user = <NDEx username>
    password = <NDEx password>
    server = <NDEx server(omit http) ie public.ndexbio.org>


**Example configuration file**

.. code-block::

    [ncipid_dev]

    user = joe123
    password = somepassword123
    server = dev.ndexbio.org


Required external tool
-----------------------

Paxtools is needed to convert the OWL files to SIF format.

Please download **paxtools.jar** (http://www.biopax.org/Paxtools/)
(requires Java 8+) and put in current working directory

Or specify path to **paxtools.jar** with :code:`--paxtools` flag on
**loadnexncipidloader.py**

Usage
-----

For more information invoke :code:`ndexloadncipid.py -h`

**Example usage**

This example assumes a valid configuration file with paxtools.jar in the working directory.

.. code-block::

   ndexloadncipid.py sif

**Example usage with sif files already downloaded**

This example assumes a valid configuration file and the SIF files are located in :code:`sif/` directory

.. code-block::

   ndexloadncipid.py --skipdownload sif
