        Python application that loads NCI-PID data into NDEx_
        
        This tool downloads OWL_ files containing NCI-PID data from: ftp://ftp.ndexbio.org/NCI_PID_BIOPAX_2016-06-08-PC2v8-API/
        and performs the following operations:
        
        **1\)** OWL files are converted to extended SIF_ format using Paxtools_ and the SIF_ file is loaded into a network
        
        **2\)** A node attribute named **type** is added to each node and is set to one of the following
           by extracting its value from **PARTICIPANT_TYPE** column in SIF_ file:
        
        * **protein** (originally ProteinReference)
        
        * **smallmolecule** (originally SmallMoleculeReference)
        
        * **proteinfamily** (set if node name has **family** and was a **protein**)
        
        * **RnaReference** (original value)
        
        * **ProteinReference;SmallMoleculeReference** (original value)
        
        **3\)** A node attribute named **alias** is added to each node and is loaded from **UNIFICATION_XREF**
        column in SIF_ file which is split by `;` into a list. Each element of this list is prefixed with **uniprot:** and t first element is set as the
        **represents** value in node and removed from the **alias** attribute. If after
        removal, the **alias** attribute value is empty, it is removed.
        
        **4\)** In SIF_ file **INTERACTION_TYPE** defines edge interaction type and **INTERACTION_PUBMED_ID** define
        value of **citation** edge attribute. The values in **citation** edge attribute are
        prefixed with **pubmed:** Once loaded redundant edges are removed
        following these conventions:
        
        * **neighbor-of** edges are removed
        
        * **controls-state-of** edges are removed if another edge connecting same nodes has one of the following interactions: **controls-state-change-of, controls-transport-of, controls-phosphorylation-of, controls-expression-of**
        
        **NOTE:** If above results in orphaned nodes, those nodes are removed as well
        
        **5\)** An edge attribute named **directed** is set to **True** if edge interaction type is one of the following (otherwise its set to **False**)
        
        .. code-block::
        
            controls-state-change-of
            controls-transport-of
            controls-phosphorylation-of
            controls-expression-of
            catalysis-precedes
            controls-production-of
            controls-transport-of-chemical
            chemical-affects
            used-to-produce
        
        **6\)** If node name matches **represents** value in node (with **uniprot:** prefix added) then the node name is replaced with gene symbol from `gene_symbol_mapping.json`_
        
        **7\)** If node name starts with **CHEBI** then node name is replaced with value of **PARTICIPANT_NAME** from SIF_ column
        
        **8\)** If node **represents** value starts with **chebi:CHEBI** the **chebi:** is removed
        
        **9\)** If **_HUMAN** in SIF_ file **PARTICIPANT_NAME** column for a given node then this value is replaced by doing a lookup in `gene_symbol_mapping.json`_, unless value in lookup is **-** in which case original name is left
        
        **10\)** Any node with **family** node name is changed as follows if a lookup of node name against **gene_symbol_mapping.json** returns one or more genes
        
        * Node attribute named **member** is added and set to list of genes found in lookup in `gene_symbol_mapping.json`_
        * Node attribute named **type** is changed to **proteinfamily**
        
        **11\)** The following network attributes are set
        
        * **name** set to name of OWL_ file with **.owl.gz** suffix removed except for **PathwayCommons.8.NCI_PID.BIOPAX** which is renamed to **NCI PID - Complete Interactions**
        * **author** (from **Curated By** column in `networkattributes.tsv`_)
        * **labels** (from **PID** column in `networkattributes.tsv`_)
        * **organism** is pulled from **organism** attribute of `style.cx`_
        * **prov:wasGeneratedBy** is set to html link to this repo with text ndexncipidloader <VERSION> (example: ndexncipidloader 1.2.0)
        * **prov:wasDerivedFrom** is set to full path to OWL_ file on ftp site
        * **reviewers** (from **Reviewed By** column in `networkattributes.tsv`_)
        * **version** is set to Abbreviated month-year (example: MAY-2019)
        * **description** is pulled from **description** attribute of `style.cx`_ except for **NCI PID - Complete Interactions** which has a hardcoded description set to `This network includes all interactions of the individual NCI-PID pathways.`
        * **networkType** is set to list of string with single entry **pathway** except for **NCI PID - Complete Interactions** which also includes **interactome**
        * **__iconurl** is set to value of `--iconurl` flag (currently defaulting to http://search.ndexbio.org/static/media/ndex-logo.04d7bf44.svg)
        * **__normalizationversion** is set to 0.1
        
        **12\)** By default each network is made public with full indexed and showcased (visible in user's home network list page)

        Configuration
        -------------
        
        The **ndexloadncipid.py** requires a configuration file in the following format be created.
        The default path for this configuration is :code:`~/.ndexutils.conf` but can be overridden with
        :code:`--conf` flag.
        
        **Format of configuration file**
        
        .. code-block::
        
            [<value in --profile (default ndexncipidloader)>]
        
            user = <NDEx username>
            password = <NDEx password>
            server = <NDEx server(omit http) ie public.ndexbio.org>
        
        
        **Example configuration file**
        
        .. code-block::

        Required external tool
        -----------------------
        
        Paxtools is needed to convert the OWL files to SIF format.
        
        Please download **paxtools.jar** (http://www.biopax.org/Paxtools/)
        (requires Java 8+) and put in current working directory
        
        Or specify path to **paxtools.jar** with :code:`--paxtools` flag on
        **loadnexncipidloader.py**
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        For more information invoke :code:`ndexloadncipid.py -h`
        
        **Example usage**
        
        This example assumes a valid configuration file with paxtools.jar in the working directory.

        History
        =======
        
        4.0.0 (2020-11-04)
        -------------------
        
        * New default behavior: **force-directed-cl** layout is now applied on
          networks via py4cytoscape library and a running instance of Cytoscape.
          Alternate Cytoscape layouts and the networkx "spring" layout can be
          run by setting appropriate value via the new **--layout** flag
        
        3.1.1 (2020-10-16)
        -------------------
        
        * Removed NODE_LABEL_POSITION discrete mapping from style since it is
          not compatible with CX 2.0
        
        3.1.0 (2019-09-11)
        -------------------
        
        * Added **--disableshowcase** flag that lets caller disable showcasing of **NEWLY** added networks which is enabled by default.
        
        * Added **--indexlevel** flag that lets caller set type of indexing performed on **NEWLY** added networks. Default is full indexing (all).
        
        3.0.0 (2019-08-02)
        -------------------
        
        * Renamed command line tool from **loadndexncipidloader.py** to **ndexloadncipid.py** to be more consistent with other loaders. Since this is a breaking change bumped to version 3.0.0
        
        * Added **--visibility** flag which lets caller dictate whether newly added networks are set to PUBLIC (default) or PRIVATE
        
        * Removed parameter **--disablcitededgemerge** since the changes in 2.0.0 causes this to no longer have any effect
        
        * Set default for **--paxtools** flag to be **paxtools.jar** which assumes the tool is in current working directory
        
        2.0.0 (2019-07-16)
        ------------------
        
        * Spring layout adjusted by increasing iterations
        
        * Code now removes all neighbor-of edges with NO data migration. controls-state-change-of
          edges are removed if more informative edges exist. Any orphaned nodes resulting from
          the removal of these edges are also removed
        
        1.6.0 (2019-07-09)
        ------------------
        
        * Added *__iconurl* network attribute to all networks
        
        * Added **interactome** to *networkType** network attribute for 'NCI PID - Complete Interactions' network
        
        1.5.1 (2019-07-09)
        ------------------
        
        * Renamed network attribute *type* to *networkType* to adhere to normalization specification
        
        1.5.0 (2019-06-28)
        ------------------
        
        * Fixed style.cx by removing view aspects that was causing networks to not render properly in cytoscape
        
        1.4.0 (2019-06-13)
        ------------------
        
        * Network PathwayCommons.8.NCI_PID.BIOPAX is now renamed
          to 'NCI PID - Complete Interactions' with alternate description.
        
        1.3.0 (2019-06-12)
        ------------------
        
        * Improved description in style.cx file (JIRA ticket UD-362)
        
        1.2.0 (2019-06-11)
        ------------------
        
        * Code now adds a citation attribute to every edge even if there is no value
          in which case an empty list is set (JIRA ticket UD-360)
        
        * Added type network attribute and set it to ['pathway'] following normalization
          guidelines
        
        1.1.0 (2019-06-10)
        ------------------
        
        * Adjusted network layout to be more compact by reducing number of iterations in
          spring layout algorithm as well as lowering the value of scale (JIRA ticket UD-360)
        
        1.0.2 (2019-05-24)
        ------------------
        
        * Removed view references from cyVisualProperties aspect of style.cx file cause it was causing issues with loading in cytoscape
        
        * Set directed edge attribute type to boolean cause it was incorrectly defaulting to a string
        
        1.0.1 (2019-05-18)
        ------------------
        
        * Renamed incorrect attribute name prov:wasDerivedBy to prov:wasDerivedFrom
          to adhere to normalization document requirements
         
        1.0.0 (2019-05-16)

        * Massive refactoring and first release where code attempts to behave as defined in README.rst
        
        0.1.1 (2019-02-15)
        ------------------
        
        * Updated data/style.cx by renaming Protein to protein and SmallMolecule
          to smallmolecule to match the new normalization conventions
        
        
        0.1.0 (2019-02-15)
        ------------------
        
        * First release
