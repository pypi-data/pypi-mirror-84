# Learning tool for teaching the Cake Baking Analogy 

Meant to make the analogy literal so that beginners can better understand the basics of functions.

1.1.0 Functions:
(All functions sleep one second after they run except complete)
measure: waits one second then prints its string argument
mixIngredients: sleeps for one second then prints "Batter is mixed"
pourBatter: waits one second then prints "Batter has been poured"
setOvenTempTo: prints "Setting oven temp", waits 0.2 seconds, prints "Heating up...", prints "Ready in x hours" where x is the oven temperature divided by 100 then stops and prints "Oven temperature set to y degrees" where y is its int argument
bakeBatter: prints "Baked x layer" where x is the ordinal form of 1 through 3 and then prints "All layers are baked!"
assembleCake: sleeps for 1 second then prints "Cake is assembled and ready to be iced!"
iceCake: prints "Cake is iced!"
complete: executes every function and takes unlimited string arguments which are use in measure and uses 500 for setOvenTemp argument.
