Description: # Learning tool for teaching the Cake Baking Analogy 
        
        Meant to make the analogy literal so that beginners can better understand the basics of functions.
        
        ## 1.1 Functions:
        (All functions sleep one second after they run except complete)\
        measure: waits one second then prints its string argument\
        mixIngredients: sleeps for one second then prints "Batter is mixed"\
        pourBatter: waits one second then prints "Batter has been poured"\
        setOvenTempTo: prints "Setting oven temp", waits 0.2 seconds, prints "Heating up...", prints "Ready in x hours" where x is the oven temperature divided by 100 then stops and prints "Oven temperature set to y degrees" where y is its int argument\
        bakeBatter: prints "Baking x layer" and then "x layer baked" where x is the ordinal form of 1 through 3 and then prints "All layers are baked!"\
        assembleCake: prints "Assembling cake..." then sleeps for 1 second then prints "Cake is assembled and ready to be iced!"\
        iceCake: prints "Icing cake..." then "Cake is iced!"\
        complete: executes every function and takes unlimited string arguments which are use in measure and uses 500 for setOvenTemp argument.
