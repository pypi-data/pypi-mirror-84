        Chartify is a Python library that makes it easy for data scientists to create charts.
        
        Why use Chartify?
        -----------------
        
        - Consistent input data format: Spend less time transforming data to get your charts to work. All plotting functions use a consistent tidy input data format.
        - Smart default styles: Create pretty charts with very little customization required.
        - Simple API: We've attempted to make the API as intuitive and easy to learn as possible.
        - Flexibility: Chartify is built on top of `Bokeh <http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/>`_, so if you do need more control you can always fall back on Bokeh's API.

        2. Install chromedriver requirement (Optional. Needed for PNG output):
            - Install google chrome.
            - Download the appropriate version of chromedriver for your OS `here <https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads>`_.
            - Copy the executable file to a directory within your PATH.
        	- View directorys in your PATH variable: ``echo $PATH``
        	- Copy chromedriver to the appropriate directory, e.g.: ``cp chromedriver /usr/local/bin``
