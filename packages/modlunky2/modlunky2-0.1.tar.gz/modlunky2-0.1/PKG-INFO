        # modlunky2
        
        Repository for modding interface for Spelunky 2.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Copy the modlunky2.exe to your Spelunky 2 installation directory and run it.
        
        
        ## Development
        
        If you'd like to contribute to `modlunky2` here are some steps to setup your environment.
        
        ### Creating VirtualEnv
        In the root directory you can make a virtualenv. It will be excluded from commits by default
        ```console
        > python -m venv venv
        ```
        
        ### Activate VirtualEnv
        
        You'll want to activate the virtual environment whenever you're testing any commands from this package
        
        #### Powershell
        ```console
        > venv\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```
        
        #### cmd
        ```console
        > venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
        ```
        
        #### bash/zsh
        ```console
        > source venv/bin/activate
        ```
        
        ### Setup
        
        Once you have your virtual environment setup and activated you'll want to finish setting up the development environment.
        
        ```console
        > pip install -r requirements.txt
        > python setup.py develop
        ```
        
        This will install any dependencies as well as setting up links on your path to your local source files. Once this is done
        you'll be able to execute the binaries right from your path after any changes to the source without the need to build or
        install anything. If you add new source files you may have to run `python setup.py develop` again to make sure they're linked.
