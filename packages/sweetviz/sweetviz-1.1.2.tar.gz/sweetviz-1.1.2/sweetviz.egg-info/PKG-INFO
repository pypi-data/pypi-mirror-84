        Sweetviz is an open source Python library that generates beautiful, high-density visualizations to kickstart EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) with a single line of code. Output is a fully self-contained HTML application.
        
        The system is built around quickly **visualizing target values** and **comparing datasets**. Its goal is to help quick analysis of target characteristics, training vs testing data, and other such data characterization tasks. 
        
        Usage and parameters are described below, [you can also find an article describing its features in depth and see examples in action HERE](https://towardsdatascience.com/powerful-eda-exploratory-data-analysis-in-just-two-lines-of-code-using-sweetviz-6c943d32f34).
        
        **October 2020 update: Sweetviz is out of beta and development is still ongoing!** Please let me know if you run into any data, compatibility or install issues! Thank you for [reporting any BUGS in the issue tracking system here](https://github.com/fbdesignpro/sweetviz/issues), and I welcome your feedback and questions on usage/features [in our forum (you should be able to log in with your Github account!)](https://sweetviz.fbdesignpro.com).

        # Features
        ![Features](http://cooltiming.com/SV/features.png)
        - **Target analysis**
          - Shows how a target value (e.g. "Survived" in the Titanic dataset) relates to other features
        - **Visualize and compare**
          - Distinct datasets (e.g. training vs test data)
          - Intra-set characteristics (e.g. male versus female)
        - **Mixed-type associations**
          - Sweetviz integrates associations for numerical (Pearson's correlation), categorical (uncertainty coefficient) and categorical-numerical (correlation ratio) datatypes seamlessly, to provide maximum information for all data types.
        - **Type inference**
          - Automatically detects numerical, categorical and text features, with optional manual overrides 
        - **Summary information** 
          - Type, unique values, missing values, duplicate rows, most frequent values
          - Numerical analysis: 
            - min/max/range, quartiles, mean, mode, standard deviation, sum, median absolute deviation, coefficient of variation, kurtosis, skewness
        
        # Upgrading
        Some people have experienced mixed results behavior upgrading through `pip`. To update to the latest from an existing install, it is recommended to `pip uninstall sweetviz` first, then simply install.
        
        # Installation
        Sweetviz currently supports Python 3.6+ and Pandas 0.25.3+. Reports are output using the base "os" module, so custom environments such as Google Colab which require custom file operations are not yet supported, although I am looking into a solution. 
        ## Using pip
        The best way to install sweetviz (other than from source) is to use pip:
        ```
        pip install sweetviz
        ```
        #### Installation issues & fixes
        In some rare cases, users have reported errors such as `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sweetviz'` and `AttributeError: module 'sweetviz' has no attribute 'analyze'`.
        In those cases, we suggest the following:
        - Make sure none of your scripts are named `sweetviz.py`, as that interferes with the library itself. Delete or rename that script (and any associated `.pyc` files), and try again.
        - Try uninstalling the library using `pip uninstall sweetviz`, then reinstalling
        - The issue may stem from using multiple versions of Python, or from OS permissions. The following Stack Overflow articles have resolved many of these issues reported: [Article 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32680081/importerror-after-successful-pip-installation/32680082), [Article 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14295680/unable-to-import-a-module-that-is-definitely-installed), [Article 3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44528638/after-pip-successful-installed-modulenotfounderror) 
        - If all else fails, post a bug issue [here on github](https://github.com/fbdesignpro/sweetviz/issues). Thank you for taking the time, it may help resolve the issue for you and everyone else!
        # Basic Usage
        Creating a report is a quick 2-line process:
        1. Create a `DataframeReport` object using one of: `analyze()`, `compare()` or `compare_intra()`
        2. Use a `show_xxx()` function to render the report. 
        
        **Note: Currently the only rendering supported is to a standalone HTML file, using a "widescreen" aspect ratio (i.e. 1080p resolution or wider).** Please let me know of formats/resolutions you would like to be supported in our [ forum](https://sweetviz.fbdesignpro.com).
        
        ## Step 1: Create the report
        There are 3 main functions for creating reports:
        - analyze(...)
        - compare(...)
        - compare_intra(...)
        
        #### Analyzing a single dataframe (and its optional target feature)
        To analyze a single dataframe, simply use the `analyze(...)` function, then the `show_html(...)` function:
        ```
        import sweetviz as sv
        
        my_report = sv.analyze(my_dataframe)
        my_report.show_html() # Default arguments will generate to "SWEETVIZ_REPORT.html"
        ```
        When run, this will output a 1080p widescreen html app in your default browser:
        ![Widescreen demo](http://cooltiming.com/SV/demo_wide.png)
        ##### Optional arguments
        The `analyze()` function can take multiple other arguments:
        ```
        analyze(source: Union[pd.DataFrame, Tuple[pd.DataFrame, str]],
                    target_feat: str = None,
                    feat_cfg: FeatureConfig = None,
                    pairwise_analysis: str = 'auto'):
        ```
        - **source:** Either the data frame (as in the example) or a tuple containing the data frame and a name to show in the report. 
        e.g. `my_df` or `[my_df, "Training"]`
        - **target_feat:** A string representing the name of the feature to be marked as "target". *Only BOOLEAN and NUMERICAL features can be targets for now.*
        - **feat_cfg:** A FeatureConfig object representing features to be skipped, or to be forced a certain type in the analysis. The arguments can either be a single string or list of strings. Parameters are `skip`, `force_cat`, `force_num` and `force_text`. The "force_" arguments override the built-in type detection. They can be constructed as follows:
        ```
        feature_config = sv.FeatureConfig(skip="PassengerId", force_text=["Age"])
        ```
        - **pairwise_analysis:** Correlations and other associations can take quadratic time (n^2) to complete. The default setting ("auto") will run without warning until a data set contains "association_auto_threshold" features. Past that threshold, you need to explicitly pass the parameter `pairwise_analysis="on"` (or `="off"`) since processing that many features would take a long time. This parameter also covers the generation of the association graphs (based on [Drazen Zaric's concept](https://towardsdatascience.com/better-heatmaps-and-correlation-matrix-plots-in-python-41445d0f2bec)):
        
        ![Pairwise sample](http://cooltiming.com/SV/pairwise.png)
        
        #### Comparing two dataframes (e.g. Test vs Training sets)
        To compare two data sets, simply use the `compare()` function. Its parameters are the same as `analyze()`, except with an inserted second parameter to cover the comparison dataframe. It is recommended to use the [dataframe, "name"] format of parameters to better differentiate between the base and compared dataframes. (e.g. `[my_df, "Train"]` vs `my_df`)
        ```
        my_report = sv.compare([my_dataframe, "Training Data"], [test_df, "Test Data"], "Survived", feature_config)
        ```
        #### Comparing two subsets of the same dataframe (e.g. Male vs Female)
        Another way to get great insights is to use the comparison functionality to split your dataset into 2 sub-populations.
        
        Support for this is built in through the `compare_intra()` function. This function takes a boolean series as one of the arguments, as well as an explicit "name" tuple for naming the (true, false) resulting datasets. Note that internally, this creates 2 separate dataframes to represent each resulting group. As such, it is more of a shorthand function of doing such processing manually.
        ```
        my_report = sv.compare_intra(my_dataframe, my_dataframe["Sex"] == "male", ["Male", "Female"], feature_config)
        ```
        ## Step 2: Show the report
        Once you have created your report object (e.g. `my_report` in the examples above), simply pass it into a `show_xxx()` function.
        
        Currently the only rendering supported is to a standalone HTML file, using a "widescreen" aspect ratio (i.e. 1080p resolution or wider). 
        Please let me know of formats/resolutions you would like to be supported in our [forum](https://sweetviz.fbdesignpro.com).
        
        So currently, simply call the following function with the desired parameters:
        
        `my_report.show_html(filepath='SWEETVIZ_REPORT.html', open_browser=True)`
        
        The `open_browser` parameter is a new addition in 1.1 to give the option to avoid opening a browser window once the HTML file is generated.
        
        # Config file
        The package contains an INI file for configuration. You can override any setting by providing your own then calling this before creating a report:
        ```
        sv.config_parser.read("Override.ini")
        ```
        **IMPORTANT #1:** it is best to load overrides **before any other command**, as many of the INI options are used in the report generation.  
        
        **IMPORTANT #2:** always set the header (e.g. `[General]` before the value, otherwise there will be an error).  
        
        ### Most useful config overrides
         You can look into the file `sweetviz_defaults.ini` for what can be overriden (warning: much of it is a work in progress and not well documented), but the most useful overrides are:
        ```
        [General]
        use_cjk_font = 1
        
        [Layout]
        show_logo = 0
        ``` 
        ##### New: Chinese, Japanse, Korean (CJK) character support
        ```
        [General]
        use_cjk_font = 1 
        ```
        Will switch the font in the graphs to use a CJK-compatible font. Although this font is not as compact, it will get rid of any warnings and "unknown character" symbols for these languages.
        ##### Remove Sweetviz logo
        ```
        [Layout]
        show_logo = 0
        ```
        Will remove the Sweetviz logo from the top of the page.

        # Special thanks & related materials
        I want Sweetviz to be a hub of the best of what's out there, a way to get the most valuable information and visualization, without reinventing the wheel.
        
        As such, I want to point some of those great resources that were inspiring and integrated into Sweetviz:
        - [Pandas-Profiling](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling) was the original inspiration for this project. Some of its type-detection code was included in Sweetviz.
        - [Shaked Zychlinski: The Search for Categorical Correlation](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-search-for-categorical-correlation-a1cf7f1888c9) is a great article about different types of variable interactions that was the basis of that analysis in Sweetviz.
        - [Drazen Zaric: Better Heatmaps and Correlation Matrix Plots in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/better-heatmaps-and-correlation-matrix-plots-in-python-41445d0f2bec) was the basis for our association graphs.
        
        **And of course, very special thanks to everyone who have contributed on Github, through reports, feedback and commits!**
