## Skaak : Python Chess Library

#### Features that will form the basic form:
 - Board representation, allowing for things like making moves, etc.
 - Move generation
 - Basic board analysis: repetition, checkmates, draws, and so forth.
 - Interface for communicating with chess engines such as stockfish
 - The creation and parsing of popular game formats: PGN, FEN, etc.
 
#### The goal
To create something like `https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess` and to then extend.

#### Why?
Because it's fun, and a great learning experience.

#### Fun Fact
`Skaak` is the word for `Chess` in the Afrikaans language, so no, this was not randomly named.
