But the Slack client currently (in its most frequently\navailable interface) does not provide any support for batch operations.\n\nSlacktivate is a powerful tool that allows you to specify the users, group\nmemberships and channels in a YAML specification file, and to have the tool\nautomatically synchronize this specification with the Slack workspace.\n\nBelow is some context to explain why I created this tool.\n\n### Batch managing users in channels\n\nAs an example:\n- users [can only be added to a channel one-by-one](https://slack.com/help/articles/201980108-Add-people-to-a-channel),\n- users can only be removed from a channel one-by-one,\n\n![Slack modal to add users to a channel as of October 2020](docs/source/_static/slack-screenshots/add-user-to-channel-modal.png)\n\nand when you are managing a Slack workspace with hundreds of users, this can\nbecome a bottleneck of operations very quickly. Slack is actively trying to\naddress this point, but so far, is not really making a difference---[the\nchannel manager that was recently introduced](https://slack.com/help/articles/360047512554-Use-channel-management-tools)\nstill only provides the same modal to add users, and no additional options to remove users.\n\nThis problem exists throughout Slack. Beyond the membership of channels, this\nissue exists also with the membership of the workspace, of groups, and so on.\n\nPart of the issue is that Slack Enterprise Grid product relies on a\ncompany\'s existing directory solution to address these needs; but this is\nof no use to the many teams that are finding success with a lower tier of\nthe service. \n\n### The solution: Automating the process\n\n<to be written>\n\n## Prerequisites: Having Owner Access and Getting an API Token\n\nIn order to use the SCIM API, you need to be an owner of the workspace, and obtain an API token with `admin` scope.\n\nAs explained in [the official Slack SCIM API documentation](https://api.slack.com/scim#access), the easiest way to obtain a valid token for the purposes of SCIM provisioning is as follows:\n1. As *a Workspace/Organization Owner*, create [a new app for your workspace](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1) (see [here](https://api.slack.com/start/overview#creating) for the documentation).\n2. Add the `admin` OAuth scope to [the "User Token Scopes" section](https://api.slack.com/authentication/quickstart#configuring).\n3. Install the app to your workspace (see [here](https://api.slack.com/start/overview#installing_distributing) for the documentation).\n4. Use the generated token (if you are provided with multiple tokens, use the "OAuth Access Token" not the "Bot User OAuth Access Token").\n\nNote that you can easily *reinstall your app* with different permissions if it turns out you did not select all the necessary permissions.\n\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed [under the LGPLv3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html),\nwith the understanding that importing a Python modular is similar in spirit to dynamically linking\nagainst it.\n\n- You can use the library/CLI `slacktivate` in any project, for any purpose,\n  as long as you provide some acknowledgement to this original project for\n  use of the library (for open source software, just explicitly including\n  `slacktivate` in the dependency such as a `pyproject.toml` or `Pipfile`\n  is acknowledgement enough for me!).\n\n- If you make improvements to `slacktivate`, you are required to make those\n  changes publicly available.\n\nThis license is compatible with the license of all the dependencies as\ndocumented in [this project\'s own `pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/jlumbroso/slacktivate/blob/master/pyproject.toml#L29-L49).\n',
