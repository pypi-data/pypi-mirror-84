Description: # Repoman
        
        Repoman is a software sources manager for Debian-based linux distributions. It
        allows you to configure system repository information and other system settings,
        as well as add, remove, and modify third-party repositories on the system.
        
        Repoman is based on [PPAExtender](https://github.com/mirkobrombin/PPAExtender)
