        # Installation
        ## With pip
        Simply run `pip install red-star`, and Red Star and all its dependencies will be automatically installed.
        You can then run Red Star by simply running `python -m red_star` or `red_star` (if Scripts is in your PATH).
        
        ## From source
        ### Installing
        Running `pip install -e .` inside the Red Star folder will install Red Star and all its dependencies automatically.
        This will allow you to run Red Star in the same way as above.
        ### Running portably
        Alternatively, one can run Red Star portably by simply navigating to the source directory and running `python red_star.py -p`.
        This will tell Red Star to keep its loose files inside the source directory, instead of placing them in your user folder.
        
        # Usage
        Starting the bot is already covered above; simply invoke `red_star`, `python -m red_star`, or `python red_star.py` to run the bot.
        On first run, a default configuration file will be copied to `~/.red_star` (`C:\Users\username\.red_star` on Windows) that must be edited before use.
        ## Command-line Arguments
        - `-[-p]ortable`: Tells the bot to run in portable mode, keeping all of its loose files in its source directory.
        Useful if you don't want to clutter your user folder, or install the bot with `pip`.
        - `-[-d]irectory`: Allows the user to specify a custom directory to place loose files. Cannot be used with `-p`.
        - `-[-l]ogfile`: Allows the user to specify a different name for the log file than the default.
        - `-[-v]erbose`: Tells the bot to output debug information while running. Can be called up to three times, increasing verbosity each time.
