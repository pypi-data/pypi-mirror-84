pystage-apt is a library to communicate with various Thorlabs' APT single-channel controllers and control different types of Thorlabs' actuator motors. It contains a large collection of motor control messages obtained from Thorlabs APT Controllers Host-Controller Communications Protocol. This document describes the low-level communications protocol and commands used between the host PC and controller units within the APT family. Those messages are included in a series of python files and are stored in a folder named ctrl_msg.
