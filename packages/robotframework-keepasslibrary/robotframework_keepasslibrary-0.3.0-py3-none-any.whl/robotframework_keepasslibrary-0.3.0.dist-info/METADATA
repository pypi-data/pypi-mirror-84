Supported KeePass versions:
- KDBX3
- KDBX4

KeepassLibrary uses the [PyKeePass](https://pypi.org/project/pykeepass/) modules internally to access KeePass databases

See https://keepass.info for more information about KeePass in general

### Example

```robotframework
*** Settings ***
Documentation     A test suite with a single test for retrieving a password.
...
...               The test loads a KeePass database named Database.kdbx using 
...               the keyfile Database.key. 
...               It then retrieves the first entry that matches the Username "User Name"
...               and logs the password from the returned KeePass database entry
Library           KeePassLibrary

*** Test Cases ***
Get KeePass Database Entry
    Load KeePass Database       Database.kdbx    keyfile=Database.key        
    ${entry}=    Get Entries By Username    User Name    first=True
    ${value}=    Get Entry Password    ${entry}  
    Log     Password for User Name is ${value}
```
