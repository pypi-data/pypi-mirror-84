## FAQ

### I cannot install online-judge-tools. What is `$ pip3 install online-judge-tools`? Please help!

Do following steps.

1.  If you use a Windows environment, use [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about). For beginners, Linux (especially, Ubuntu) is often easier than Windows.
    -   Also, if you use Visual Studio Code (or other IDEs), close it and forget it for a while. Don't use consoles in IDEs.
1.  :snake: Install [Python](https://www.python.org/). If you use Ubuntu (including Ubuntu in WSL), run `$ sudo apt install python3`.
1.  Check your Python with running `$ python3 --version`. If it says `Python 3.x.y`, it's OK.
    -   If it says something like `Command 'python3' not found`, you have failed to install Python.
    -   If the version of Python is too old, it's not OK. The `x` must be greater than or equal to `5`. If `x` is lower than `5`, upgrade your Python.
1.  :package: Install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). If you use Ubuntu (including Ubuntu in WSL), run `$ sudo apt install python3-pip`.
1.  Check your pip with running `$ pip3 --version`. If it says something like `pip x.y.z ...`, it's OK.
    -   If it says something like `Command 'pip3' not found`, you have failed to install pip.
    -   Even if `pip3` is not found, you may be able to use `python3 -m pip` instead of `pip3`. Try `$ python3 -m pip --version`. If it says `pip x.y.z ...`, it's OK.
    -   Don't use `pip` or `pip2`. Use `pip3`.
1.  :dart: Run `$ pip3 install online-judge-tools` to install online-judge-tools. If it says `Successfully installed online-judge-tools-x.y.z` (or, `Requirement already satisfied: online-judge-tools`), it's OK.
    -   If it says `Permission denied`, run `$ sudo pip3 install online-judge-tools` or `$ pip3 install --user online-judge-tools`.
1.  Check online-judge-tools with `$ oj --version`. If It must say something like `online-judge-tools x.y.z`.
    -   If it says something like `Command 'oj' not found`, you need to set [`PATH`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_%28variable%29).
        1.  Find the path of the `oj` file with running `$ find / -name oj 2> /dev/null`. The file is often at `/home/ubuntu/.local/bin/oj` or `/usr/local/bin/oj`.
        1.  Check the found `oj` file is actually `oj`, with running `$ /home/ubuntu/.local/bin/oj --version`.
        1.  Add the directory which contains the `oj` to your `PATH`. For example, if `oj` is `/home/ubuntu/.local/bin/oj`, write `export PATH="/home/ubuntu/.local/bin:$PATH"` in the end of `~/.bashrc`.
            -   Don't write `export PATH="$PATH:/home/ubuntu/.local/bin/oj"`. It's not a directory.
            -   If you don't use bash, write a right settings to the right file depending on your shell. For example, if you use Mac OS, your shell might zsh. For zsh, write the same command to `~/.zshrc`.
        1.  Reload the configuration with `source ~/.bashrc`.
            -   If you don't use bash, use an appropriate way.
        1.  Check your `PATH` with `$ echo $PATH`. If it says `/home/ubuntu/.local/bin:...`, it's OK.
    -   If it says something like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'onlinejudge'`, you have failed to install online-judge-tools and your environment is broken. Run `$ pip3 install --force-reinstall online-judge-tools` to reinstall.
    -   If it says something like `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`, you have used `pip2` by mistake. Run `$ pip2 uninstall online-judge-tools`, and retry to install.
1.  That's all.

If you couldn't read many sentences of above instructions (e.g. if you didn't know what "run `$ python3 --version`" means), please ask your friends for help.
If you cannot install online-judge-tools even following the instructions, please add comments to [this issue](https://github.com/kmyk/online-judge-tools/issues/717).

### Other questions

-   I usually make one directory per one contest (or, site). Can I keep using this style?
    -   Yes, you can use the `--directory` (`-d`) option or `$ rm -rf test/`. However, we don't recommend this style, because you should make additional test cases by yourself and run stress tests to maximize your rating.
-   Can I download all sample cases of all problems at once?
    -   No, but you can use `oj-prepare` command in [kmyk/online-judge-template-generator](https://github.com/kmyk/online-judge-template-generator).
-   Can I automatically compile my source code before testing?
    -   Yes, use your shell. Run `$ g++ main.cpp && oj t`.
-   Can I automatically submit code after it passes tests?
    -   Yes, use your shell. Run `$ oj t && oj s main.cpp`. By the way, you need to take care of problems whose sample cases are not so strong.
-   Can I remove the delays and the `[y/N]` confirmation before submitting code?
    -   Yes, put `--wait=0` option and `--yes` option to `oj s` subcommand. Of course, we don't recommend this. They exist for failsafe. For example, please consider a situation where if you save 3 seconds, you will move up 3 places on the standings. In such a case, if you get a penalty of 5 minutes, then you will move down at least 300 places on the standings.
-   Can I clear my download history to omit the URL of the problem to submit?
    -   Yes, remove the history file, whose name is `download-history.jsonl`.
-   Is my password stored?
    -   Your password is not stored into any files. This program stores only your session tokens (but of course, it's still credentials). Please read [onlinejudge/_implementation/command/login.py](https://github.com/kmyk/online-judge-tools/blob/master/onlinejudge/_implementation/command/login.py).
-   Can I specify problems by their IDs or names, instead of URLs?
    -   No. It may sound nice, but actually, hard to use and maintain.
-   Does the config file exist?
    -   No. You can use your `.bashrc` (or similar files) instead. It's a config file of your shell. Read [man bash](https://linux.die.net/man/1/bash) and write shell aliases or shell functions. For example, if you want to use Python code for tests by default, write `alias oj-test-python='oj t -c "python3 main.py"'` (alias) to `.bashrc` and use `$ oj-test-python`, or write `function oj-test-python() { FILE="$1" ; shift ; oj t -c "python3 '$FILE'" "$@" ; }` (function) and use `oj-test-python main.py`.
