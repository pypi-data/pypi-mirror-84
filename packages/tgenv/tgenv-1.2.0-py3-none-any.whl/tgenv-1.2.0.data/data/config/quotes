Microsoft isn't evil, they just make really crappy operating systems.
Software is like sex : it's better when it's free..
A computer is like air conditioning - it becomes useless when you open Windows
All operating systems sucks, but Linux just sucks less
Those that can, do. Those that can't, complain.
If Microsoft ever does applications for Linux it means I've won.
When you say 'I wrote a program that crashed Windows,' people just stare at you blankly and say 'Hey, I got those with the system, for free.'
In my opinion MS is a lot better at making money than it is at making good operating systems.
Real quality means making sure that people are proud of the code they write, that they're involved and taking it personally.
My name is Linus, and I am your God.
I am not out to destroy Microsoft, that would be a completely unintended side effect.
It's what I call "mental masturbation", when you engage is some pointless intellectual exercise that has no possible meaning.
So NVIDIA, fuck you!
