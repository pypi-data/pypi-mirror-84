My study "Government Equity Capital Market Intervention and Stock Returns" with Andy

broad-index equity ETFs on asset prices over time, which is valuable information at a time when the 
Federal Reserve is pursuing unprecedented levels of market intervention and even purchasing corporate debt. My job 
market paper, "Valuation without Cash Flows: What are Cryptoasset Fundamentals?" gives cryptocurrency investors 
both a theoretical framework and empirical models to assess the value of these assets, which could increase adoption and 
benefit society through elimination of counterparty risk, increased transparency, and speed of payments. 
My joint work on "OSPIN: Informed Trading in Options and Stock Markets" with
Yong Jin, Mahendrarajah Nimalendran, and Sugata Ray develops a new model to estimate the probability of informed 
trading that is more accurate as it considers the information in both the stock and options markets jointly, 
whereas prior models considered only stock markets,
which should be useful to researchers analyzing the information structure of markets and especially volatility 
information. Finally, my work on
"Are Investors Paying (for) Attention?" furthers the behavioral asset pricing literature focusing on investor attention,
the understanding of which may lead to more efficient prices as investors incorporate these effects into their 
valuation models. Each of my existing studies puts me down a path to do further research in those areas and I have 
a deep pipeline of works in progress.

only a few students. I structure my courses to appeal to multiple learning types including auditory, visual, 
and kinesthetic learning and supplement by meeting with students to ensure that all students have an equal
opportunity to succeed. Financial Modeling is a capstone, senior course, which was previously taught using Excel but 
I have restructured it to focus mainly on Python skills. This is the first time a programming language has been taught
in an undergraduate finance course at UF, and one of only a handful of times a Ph.D. student has been allowed to 
teach a capstone course. I was granted this opportunity due to my teaching accolades, 4.8/5 evaluations and the

larger emphasis on creating open-source software. My commitment to open-source is a commitment to inclusion and

at a university that encourages such efforts.
