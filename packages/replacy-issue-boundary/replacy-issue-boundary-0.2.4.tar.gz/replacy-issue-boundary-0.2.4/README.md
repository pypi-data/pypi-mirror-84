## Developing

The CI/CD in this project is great. GitHub Actions run linting and tests on any PR. If you merge into master, [release-drafter](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter) drafts a new release based on PR commits and tags (e.g. if the PR is tagged `feature` and `minor` it will create a minor version bump with the changes labeled as Features).

I can't figure out the automatic versioning bit... leaving it in a broken state for now :/
