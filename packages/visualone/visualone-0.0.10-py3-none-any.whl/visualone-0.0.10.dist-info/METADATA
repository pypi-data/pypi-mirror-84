Visual One's few shot learning framework allows you to train models for computer vision tasks using only a few samples.

## Quickstart
1. Install the package:
`pip install visualone`


2. Submit your email [here](https://getvisualone.com/access) to receive your public and private keys via email.


3. Train a model by providing some positive samples and some negative sampels:
```python
from visualone import vedx

client = vedx.client(public_key, access_key)

model = client.train(positive_samples, negative_samples)

```

4. Apply the trained model to a new image to do prediction:
```python
client.predict(model['task_id'], image_file)
```
## 

## Description of inputs and outputs:
#### Trianing:
```python
vedx.client(public_key, access_key)
```

`positive_samples`/`negative_samples` must be either:
- `str`: The path to a directory containing image files representing all of the positive/negative samples.<br>
Or<br>
- `list` (of strings): The name of the individual files corresponding to the positive/negative samples. 

Returns a `dict` with the following keys:<br>
`task_id`: A unique task id generated for this task. You need to pass this to `client.predict` to do prediction.<br>
`n_positive_samples`: The number of positive samples used for training the model.<br>
`n_negative_samples`: The number of negative samples used for training the model.<br>
`success`: `1` if the training was done successfully. `0` if an error occured.<br>
`message`: A brief message describing the error if an error occurs.

#### Prediction:
```python
client.predict(task_id, image_file)
```

`task_id`: The unique task id corresponding to the trained model returned by `vedx.train` <br>
`image_file`: The path to the file for which you want to do inference.

Returns a `dict` with the following keys:<br>
`task_id`: The task id corresponding to the model.<br>
`prediction`: A boolean representing the model prediction. `True` means the model predicted a positive label for the given image. `False` means the model predicted a negative label for the given image. <br>
`confidence`: A number between 0 and 100 representing the confidence of the model for this prediction. <br>
`latency`: The time it took to do the prediction in millisecond.
