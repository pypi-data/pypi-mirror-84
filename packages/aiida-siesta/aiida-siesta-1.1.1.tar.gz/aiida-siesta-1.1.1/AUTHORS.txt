The Siesta input plugin was originally developed by Victor M. Garcia-Suarez.

Alberto Garcia further improved the Siesta input plugin and wrote the parser for Siesta and the STM plugin.

Emanuele Bosoni contributed the band-structure support for the Siesta plugin.

Vladimir Dikan and Alberto Garcia developed the workflows and
refined the architecture of the package.

Vladimir Dikan and Emanuele Bosoni ported the plugin and the base workflow to AiiDA 1.0.
Alberto Garcia futher refined the 1.0-compatible functionality.

Since November 2019, Emanuele Bosoni is in charge of the code's development and maintenance,
under the supervision of Alberto Garcia.

Pol Febrer contributed the SiestaIterator and SiestaConverger workflows, including the underline
abstract classes system.

We gratefully acknowledge the help and support of the AiiDA team in
Lausanne.
