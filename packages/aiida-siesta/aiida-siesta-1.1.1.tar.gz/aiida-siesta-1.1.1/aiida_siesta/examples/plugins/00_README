This folder contains examples devoted to explain how to perform several tasks making use of the plugins 
distributed in aiida_siesta.
These examples should be consider templates that users should modify according to their will in order
to perform specific tasks on their own particular system.
All the examples can be run with the following syntax:
	runaiida example_name.py {--send, --dont-send} {options}
The choice "--send" submits the example to the daemon. The choice "--dont-send" creates a test folder
in /submit_test, but it does not actually run the calculation.
The "options" might vary according to the example, but almost always the first argument that can 
be passed is "code@computer", that specifies the name of the AiiDA code to be used in the example.
Therefore the line:
	runaiida example_name.py {--send, --dont-send} code@computer
should almost always be able to run the example without errors, unless your "computer" requires
to pass the name of the account or the queue where to run the calculation. In that case,
this information must be provoded inside the script, in the "resources" dictionary.
