Some of the examples use explicitly pseudopotential files contained in the
data/sample-psf-family folder.

Other examples set up automatically the pseudopotential dictionary by searching for
the appropriate PsfData nodes in a "pseudopotential family", named 'sample_psf_family'.
Before they can be run, the family's .psf files have to be uploaded to the database by executing:

  verdi data psf uploadfamily /path/to/data/sample-psf-family sample_psf_family "Sample PSF family"
