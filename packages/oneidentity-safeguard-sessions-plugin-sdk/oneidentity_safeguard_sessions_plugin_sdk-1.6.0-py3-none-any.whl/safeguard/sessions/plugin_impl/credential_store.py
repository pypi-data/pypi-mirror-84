    :synopsis: Fake CredentialStore implementation

To inject a user defined CredentialStore database into the :class:`CredentialStore \
<safeguard.sessions.plugin.credential_store.CredentialStore>` API when testing outside the SPS box.

Patch/overwrite the ``safeguard.sessions.plugin_impl.credential_store.credential_stores`` with your own dictionary.

Note that for x509 certificates, the fake credential_store does not decrypt password protected private keys.

The ``credential_stores`` is a dictionary where the key is the name of the local Credential Store policy to define.
Inside a policy the data is keyed with user name first, then host name and then as value a list of passwords, private
keys or X509 credentials. Passwords are encoded as a simple sequence of strings. Private keys and X509 credentials are
encoded as maps where "type" indicates the kind of data present in the map.

See the examples bellow for more information.


Example usage with pytest and monkeypatch

        testdb = {
            # This user has a password and a private key as well
            "user": {"host": [("password",), ({"type": "ssh-rsa", "key": "theKey"},)]},
        }
        monkeypatch.setitem(credential_stores, 'local', testdb)

        ''')

        cs = CredStore.from_config(pc)
