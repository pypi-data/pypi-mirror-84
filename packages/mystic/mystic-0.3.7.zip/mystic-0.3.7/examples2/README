Files in this directory demonstrate several use cases for mystic's
constraints solvers and penalty functions, including working with
symbolic constraints, inequality constraints, and special cases
like constraining to the set of integers.

Dependencies:
 - No new dependencies are required.

Naming conventions:
 - Several problems are reused to demonstrate alternate formulations. Alternate formulations are denoted by appending `_alt` and `_alt2` to the name. Variants
show different ways to build mystic's constraints and penalty funtions. Also,
within a single file, there may be multiple solutions for the same problem,
using a penalty, constraints, or both.
