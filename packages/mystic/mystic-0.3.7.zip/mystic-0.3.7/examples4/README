Files in this directory demonstrate use of mystic to solve for conservative
estimates of uncertainty bounds using McDairmid's inequality. The basic problem
of solving for McDiarmid bounds is extended to calculations of subregions of
parameter space, and compared to the solved diameter for the entire region.
In many cases, mystic's ensemble solvers are used, and parallel computing using
pathos or pyina is demonstrated.


== Notes on mystic examples4 ==
Dependencies:
 - examples with "PP" or "MM" require pathos to be installed.
 - examples with "MPI", "MSUB", or "QUSB" require pyina to be installed.
 - examples with "SUB" require a specific cluster scheduler (see below).

Naming conventions:
 - examples with "TEST" do not use parallel computing.
 - examples with "surrogate" are different uses of McDiarmid's inequality.
 - examples with "diam" are calculations of McDiarmid's bounds.
 - examples with "McD" compare McDiarmid bounds of a region to it's subregions.
 - examples with "cut" compare region to subregions, w/ alternate cut algoritms.
 - examples with "samples" compare subregion sampled and McDairmid prob mass.
 - examples with "batchgrid" use mystic's `LatticeSolver`.
 - examples with "scatter" use mystic's `BuckshotSolver`.
 - examples with "PP" use pathos's `ParallelPool`.
 - examples with "MM" use pathos's `ProcessPool`.
 - examples with "MPI" use pyina's `Mpi` launcher.
 - examples with "MSUB" use pyina's `MoabSlurm` launcher.
 - examples with "QSUB" use pyina's `TorqueMpi` launcher.
