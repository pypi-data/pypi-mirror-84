Files in this directory demonstrate use cases for some of mystic's "advanced"
features, such as using dimensional collapse detectors, building a surrogate
for an unknown surface, or using support vectors in optimization.


== Notes on mystic examples3 ==
Dependencies:
  - examples with "svc" in the name require `matplotlib`.
  - examples with "surface" and "searcher" require `scipy` and `matplotlib`.

Naming convention:
  - `collapse` denotes use of dimensional collapse detectors
  - `searcher` denotes using mystic to find all minima and maxima
  - `surface` denotes using mystic to interpolate an unknown surface
  - `svc` denotes use of support vectors in classification
