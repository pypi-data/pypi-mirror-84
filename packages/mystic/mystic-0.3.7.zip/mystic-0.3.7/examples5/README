Files in this directory demonstrate use of mystic to solve for optimal
uncertainty bounds using OUQ. The same basic problem is reused with different
input and output moment constraints applied.


== Notes on mystic examples5 ==
Dependencies:
 - No new dependencies are required.

Naming conventions:
 - examples with "TEST" do not use parallel computing.
 - examples with "OUQ" use optimal uncertainty quantification (OUQ).
 - examples with "diam" are calculations of optimal bounds.
