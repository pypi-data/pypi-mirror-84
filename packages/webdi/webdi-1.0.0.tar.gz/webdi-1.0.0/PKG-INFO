Description: # A Simple Dependency Injection Container for Web Apps
        
        This module contains a simple dependency injection container that is optimized
        for web apps. You define relationships once, and then each request (probably
        via middleware) receives a container that references the once-defined
        definition to build memoized services for just that request.
