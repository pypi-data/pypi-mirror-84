=======================================================
Tests the resolution of content divergence: interrupted
=======================================================

This file intend to cover case where evolve has to be interrupted.

This test aims at gather test case for --abort, --continue and --stop


Tests for the --abort flag for `hg evolve` command while content-divergence resolution
======================================================================================

The `--abort` flag aborts the interrupted evolve by undoing all the work which
was done during resolution i.e. stripping new changesets created, moving
bookmarks back, moving working directory back.

This test contains cases when `hg evolve` is doing content-divergence resolution.

Setup
=====

  $ cat >> $HGRCPATH <<EOF

  > [alias]
  > glog = log -GT "{rev}:{node|short} {desc}\n ({bookmarks}) {phase}"
  > [experimental]
  > evolution.allowdivergence = True
  > [extensions]
  > EOF
  $ echo "evolve=$(echo $(dirname $TESTDIR))/hgext3rd/evolve/" >> $HGRCPATH

  $ hg init abortrepo
  $ cd abortrepo
  $ echo ".*\.orig" > .hgignore
  $ hg add .hgignore
  $ hg ci -m "added hgignore"
  $ for ch in a b c d; do echo foo > $ch; hg add $ch; hg ci -qm "added "$ch; done;

Tests for the --stop flag for `hg evolve` command while resolving content-divergence
==================================================================================

The `--stop` flag stops the interrupted evolution and delete the state file so
user can do other things and comeback and do evolution later on

This is testing cases when `hg evolve` command is doing content-divergence resolution.

Setup
=====

  $ hg init stoprepo
  $ cd stoprepo
  $ echo ".*\.orig" > .hgignore
  $ hg add .hgignore
  $ hg ci -m "added hgignore"
  $ for ch in a b c d; do echo foo > $ch; hg add $ch; hg ci -qm "added "$ch; done;
