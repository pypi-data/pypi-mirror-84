Description: # utm-zone
        
        Find the UTM zone for your GeoJSON. 
        
        Provided a GeoJSON object (with coordinates using WGS84), calculate the Proj.4 definition or EPSG code for a suitable UTM zone for this geometry. This will only work if the geometry has limited geographic size, so that it can fit into a single UTM zone.
        
        Note that this module does not do any reprojection of coordinates, you might want to look at [pyproj](https://pypi.org/project/pyproj/) for that.
        
        For a rough overview of how the UTM zone is calculated, have a look at [https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/190209/467](https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/190209/467).
        
        See also [https://github.com/perliedman/utm-zone](https://github.com/perliedman/utm-zone) for a JavaScript version of this module.
