Description: # instaclient
        
        **instaclient** is a Python library for accessing Instagram's features.
        With this library you can create Instagram Bots with ease and simplicity. The InstaClient takes advantage of the selenium library to excecute tasks which are not allowed in the Instagram Graph API (such as sending DMs).
        
        The only thing you need to worry about is to spread your requests throughout the day to avoid reaching Instagram spam limits.

        ## Usage
        #### CREATE THE CLIENT
        ```python
        from instaclient import InstaClient
        from instaclient.errors import *
        
        # Create a instaclient object
        client = InstaClient() # Only the ChromeDriver is available at the moment
        ```
        #### LOGIN INTO INSTAGRAM
        ```python
        from instaclient.errors import *
        
        try:
            client.login(username=username, password=password) # Go through Login Procedure
        except VerificationCodeNecessary:
            # This error is raised if the user has 2FA turned on.
            code = input('Enter the 2FA security code generated by your Authenticator App or sent to you by SMS')
            client.input_verification_code(code)
        except SuspisciousLoginAttemptError as error:
            # This error is reaised by Instagram
            if error.mode == SuspisciousLoginAttemptError.EMAIL:
                code = input('Enter the security code that was sent to you via email: ')
            else:
                code = input('Enter the security code that was sent to you via SMS: ')
            client.input_security_code(code)
        ```
        #### SEND A DIRECT MESSAGE
        ```python
        result = client.send_dm('username', 'Message to send') # send a DM to a user
        ```
        > Make sure to distrubute your client.send_dm() requests over a period of time to avoid reaching Instagram's spam limits.
        #### GET A USER'S FOLLOWERS
        ```python
        followers = client.scrape_followers(user='username')
        # Get first 2000 followers of the user, returning a callback every 15 followers (default callback is a terminal print statement)
        ```
        > The client.scrape_followers() method can take a lot of time depending on the amount of followers you want to scrape.
        
        This method might be updated in the near future to cache scraped data in a SQLite database or to scrape the followers in a separate thread with a queue.
