## OrglabExt

This package is a low-level API for interacting with the OrgLab COM interface. This package does not launch an instance of Origin and provides a faster, yet more limited, API than the [OriginExt package](https://pypi.org/project/OriginExt/). This package is largely undocumented and support is limited.

Currently the [originpro package](https://pypi.org/project/originpro/) is not compatible with this package.

### Installation
This package is Windows only and requires that the [Orglab COM library](https://www.originlab.com/index.aspx?go=Products/Orglab) be installed locally.

To install the package, run:
```
pip install OrglabExt
```

### Documentation
Limited documentation is available in the [OriginLab External Python Documentation](https://www.originlab.com/doc/ExternalPython).

### Support
Limited support is available on the [Origin Forum for Python](https://my.originlab.com/forum/forum.asp?FORUM_ID=29).
