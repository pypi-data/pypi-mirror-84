Description: # 'Submission' Package for various online competitions.
        
        This package helps the user to make submission file in '.csv' format (viz the criterion for most competitions) in a simple way.
        
        Installation:
        
        Run the following to install,

        pip install submission
        
        How it works?
        
        It takes the algorithm, training dataset, test dataset, X variables, Y variables, column names (particular columns required for submission) and name of submission file (desired by the user) as input and produces an outputs the RMSE and Cross-Validation score of that model and in .csv for submitting in the competition.
        
        How to use:
        
        from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
        
        DT = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=15, min_samples_leaf=100)
        
        submission.modelfit(DT, train_df, test_df, X, Y, IDcol, 'DT.csv')
        
        Output:
        
        Model Report
        
        RMSE : 2914
        
        CV Score : Mean - 2941 | Std - 20.86 | Min - 2907 | Max - 2975
