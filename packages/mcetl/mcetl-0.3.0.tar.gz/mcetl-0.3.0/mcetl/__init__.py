mcetl - An Extract-Transform-Load framework focused on materials characterization
=======================================================================================

mcetl provides user interfaces for processing data, performing peak fitting, and
plotting data.

mcetl is focused on easing the time required to process data files. It does this
by allowing the user to define DataSource objects which contains the information
for reading files for that DataSource (such as what separator to use, which
rows and columns to use, labels for the columns, etc.), the calculations that
will be performed on the data, and the options for writing the data to Excel
(formatting, placement in the worksheet, etc.).

In addition, mcetl provides peak fitting and plotting user interfaces that
can be used without creating any DataSource objects.
