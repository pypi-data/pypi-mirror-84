        LLDP Agent for Big Switch Networks integration.
        
        This the python27 version that is used for RHOSP13 and OpenStack Queens branch.
        
        For Earlier version, the LLDP Agent is inside the plugin package.
        
        Python3 environment is not supported by this version.
        
        This custom LLDP agent is used to send LLDPs on interfaces connected to
        Big Cloud Fabric (BCF). In environments with os-net-config installed, it reads
        config from os-net-config to automagically identify and send LLDPs.
        
        For all other purposes, Big Switch Openstack Installer (BOSI) configures the
        service file based on environment info.
