Description: Products.PrintingMailHost
        =========================
        
        This is a hack. :)
        
        This product, when installed, will check if Zope is running in debug mode,
        and if so, monkey patch (that is, grab the internals of, squeeze tight, then
        rip hard, just like monkeys do) Zope's MailHost class, meaning that *any and
        all* uses of a MailHost will be "fixed" so that instead of sending mail, it
        prints messages to the zope event log.
        
        This is useful if you don't have a local mailhost for testing, or if you
        prefer not to spam the crap out of yourself whilst finding out if your bulk
        mail script is working.
        
        If Zope is not running in debug mode, it will not install itself. However,
        I wouldn't recommend putting it on a production site. You never know what
        those monkeys may get up to...
        
        You can optionally enable the PrintingMailHost with an environment variable
        as of version 0.3.  See the installation instructions for more information
        about how to use it.

            Fixed to work both with old-style and new-style classes. Extended
            to also patch SecureMailBase from SecureMailHost, if available.

        Products.PrintingMailHost Installation
        ======================================
        
        To install Products.PrintingMailHost into your Plone instance in
        buildout, you can do this:
        
        - Add ``Products.PrintingMailHost`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
            [instance]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                Products.PrintingMailHost
        
        - If you want to enable PrintingMailHost when debug-mode is off::
        
            [instance]
            ...
            environment-vars =
                ...
                ENABLE_PRINTING_MAILHOST True
        
        - If you want to disable PrintingMailHost when debug-mode is on::
        
            [instance]
            ...
            environment-vars =
                ...
                ENABLE_PRINTING_MAILHOST False
        
        - If PrintingMailHost is enabled, and you *additionally* want to send
          each email to a fixed address, you can add another environment
          variable::
        
            [instance]
            ...
            environment-vars =
                ...
                PRINTING_MAILHOST_FIXED_ADDRESS admin@example.org
        
          Or multiple addresses separated by spaces::
        
                PRINTING_MAILHOST_FIXED_ADDRESS one@example.org two@example.org
        
          For clarity: this first prints the email, with the original
          recipient address, and then sends an actual email with the same
          contents to the fixed address you have specified.  The original
          recipient is visible in the ``To:`` field.  It is similar to
          receiving a blind carbon copy (bcc) of an email, except that the
          original recipient never gets the email.
        
        - Re-run buildout in order to make any of the above changes active::
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.1.5 (2020-11-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix support for MailHost 4.10 (see `issue 33 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Products.MailHost/issues/33>`_).
          [pbauer]
        
        
        1.1.4 (2020-06-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed ``SyntaxError`` in previous release.  [tareqalam]
        
        
        1.1.3 (2020-06-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Encoding fix for Python 3
          [ajung]
        
        
        1.1.2 (2019-03-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Restore compatability with plone.api.
          [pbauer]
        
        
        1.1.1 (2019-02-28)
        ------------------
        
        - Add support Python 3
          [pbauer]
        
        
        1.1.0 (2018-06-08)
        ------------------
        
        - Check environment variables in Zope2 `initialize` instead of import time.
          This allows to configure environment-vars in zope.conf and use them when
          starting the instance with slc.zopescript
          [fRiSi]
        
        1.0 (2016-09-20)
        ----------------
        
        - Treat ``FIXED_ADDRESS`` as a list.  Previously, depending on your
          Plone version. a fixed address could get interpreted as a list of
          single-character email addresses, which of course does not work.
          Now it works properly.  You can also give a list of addresses by
          separating them using spaces: ``one@example.org two@example.org``.
          Fixes https://github.com/collective/Products.PrintingMailHost/issues/4
          [maurits]
        
        
        0.8 (2015-04-16)
        ----------------
        
        - Add environment variable ``PRINTING_MAILHOST_FIXED_ADDRESS`` to send
          all emails to a single, fixed address.  PrintingMailHost still needs
          to be enabled, so this is in addition to printing.
          https://github.com/collective/Products.PrintingMailHost/issues/2
          [maurits]
        
        - Since we can enable PMH via an environment variable and thus when not
          running in debug mode / foreground, emails are no longer printed, but
          written to the zope event log.
          [pysailor]

        0.3 (2009-03-22)
        ----------------
        
        - Decode base64 encoded email messages
          [claytron]
        
        - Added environment variable (ENABLE_PRINTING_MAILHOST) to enable

        ---
        
        - Updated to use the new standard log mechanism: logging.getLogger.
          Reformated messages/docstrings.
          [dtremea] (2006-03-17)

          available.
          [dtremea] (2005-10-23)
        
        - Fixed to work both with old-style and new-style classes, as in
          the later, dict is a 'dictproxy' instance, which doesn't have the
          setitem method. Bumpped version. Noted changes. And clean up
          whitespaces, of course... ;-)
          [dtremea] (2005-10-23)
        
        - Initial creation/release
