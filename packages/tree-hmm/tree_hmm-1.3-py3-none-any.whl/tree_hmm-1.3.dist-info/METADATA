### What is a Hidden Markov model(HMM)?

* Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are a formal foundation for making probabilistic 
models of linear sequence. They provide a conceptual 
toolkit for building complex models just by drawing an intuitive picture. 
They are at the heart of a diverse range of programs, including genefinding, 
profile searches, multiple sequence alignment and regulatory site identification. 
HMMs are the Legos of computational sequence analysis.

### Why a Hidden Markov model(HMM)?

* There are lots of cases where you can't observe the states you are interested in but you
can see the effect of being in the state. The observed effect of being in the state is called "emissions" or "observations".

### What is a tree?
In graph theory, a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path, or equivalently a connected acyclic undirected graph. 
Tree represents the nodes connected by edges. It is a non-linear data structure. It has the following properties.

* One node is marked as Root node.
* Every node other than the root is associated with one parent node.
* Each node can have an arbitrary number of child node.

### What is a Poly-tree?

* A poly-tree is simply a directed acyclic graph whose underlying undirected graph is a tree.

### What is a Tree Hidden Markov model(TreeHMM)?
* It is the same as an HMM but where the states are linked via a (poly)tree structure rather than a simple path.

### What is forward-backward algorithm?
* The Forwardâ€“Backward algorithm is the conventional, recursive, efficient
 way to evaluate a Hidden Markov Model, that is, to compute the probability of 
 an observation sequence given the model. This probability can be used to classify
 observation sequences in recognition applications.
 The goal of the forward-backward algorithm is to find the conditional 
 distribution over hidden states given the data.

### What is baum-welch algorithm?

* The Baum-Welch algorithm is a dynamic programming approach and a 
special case of the expectation-maximization algorithm (EM algorithm).
The purpose is to tune the parameters of the HMM, namely the state 
transition matrix, the emission matrix, and the initial state distribution,
such that the model is maximally like the observed data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites 
#### Create a virtual environment 

* At it's core, the main purpose of Python virtual environments is to create an isolated environment for Python projects. This means that each project can have it's own dependencies, regardless of what dependencies every other project has.

* On macOS and Linux:

        python3 -m venv envname

* On Windows:

        py -m venv envname        
#### Activate the virtual environment

* On macOS and Linux:

        source env/bin/activate
* On Windows:

        .\env\Scripts\activate

### Installation

        pip install treehmm


# Package Documentation

This is an extension to normal HMMs where the states are connected via a
poly-tree structure rather than simply a path. Moreover, upon available data, 
some of the hidden states can be observed, and hence, can be estimated more 
accurately."
This package is based on a R package and is 40% faster than it.

There are six python files of interest.

* initialize_HMM.py
* backward_sequence_generator.py
* forward_sequence_generator.py
* backward.py
* forward.py

## initialize_HMM.py

* emissions: It is a list of numpy array consisting discrete values of
            emissions(where "M" is the possible number of emissions) for each
            feature variable

            describes the topology of the tree

            initial probabilities for the states, where "N" is the possible
            number of states(Optional). Default is equally probable states

            possible number of states(Optional).

## hmm_train_and_test : Inferring the parameters of a tree Hidden Markov Model via the Baum-Welch algorithm

### Description

* For an initial Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with some assumed initial parameters and a given set of observations at all the nodes of the tree, the Baum-Welch algorithm infers optimal parameters to the HMM. Since the Baum-Welch algorithm is a variant of the Expectation-Maximisation algorithm, the algorithm converges to a local solution which might not be the global optimum. Note that if you give the training and validation data, the function will message out AUC and AUPR values after every iteration. Also, validation data must contain more than one instance of either of the possible states

### Usage

* observed_states_training_nodes: (Optional) It is a (L * 2) dataframe where L is the number of training nodes where state values are known. First column should be the node number and the second column being the corresponding known state values of the nodes
* observed_states_validation_nodes: (Optional) It is a (L * 2) dataframe where L is the number of validation nodes where state values are known. First column should be the node number and the second column being the corresponding known state values of the nodes
* maxIterations: It is the maximum number of iterations in the Baum-Welch algorithm. Default is 50
* delta: Additional termination condition, if the transition and emission matrices converge, before reaching the maximum number of iterations(code{maxIterations}). The difference of transition and emission parameters in consecutive iterations must be smaller than code{delta} to terminate the algorithm. Default is 1e-5.
* pseudoCount: Adding this amount of pseudo counts in the estimation-step of the Baum-Welch algorithm. Default is zero

### Returns

* learntHMM:  A dictionary of three elements, first being the infered HMM whose representation is equivalent to the representation in initialize_HMM, second being a list of statistics of algorithm and third being the final state probability distribution at all nodes.


### Examples

    sample_tree = np.array([0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]).reshape(5, 5)  # for "X" (5 nodes) shaped tree
