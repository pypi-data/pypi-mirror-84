# Square Root Simplification algorithm



Smath stands for SquareMATH. Algorithm written exclusively in Python and used to simplify square roots



# How To Use


Firstly, import the spl function from the file (from smath import spl). Then, call the spl() function and parse in a string argument; for example if you want the square root of 125, you would parse in "!125"; note this is using the ! instead of the √ (that char is not on the keyboard). If you want the simplification of 5√125, you would parse "5!125".


Also note the function returns a string value.
