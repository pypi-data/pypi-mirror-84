        [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/dpytest/badge/?version=latest)](https://dpytest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
        
        
        This is a package to allow testing of discord.py.
        It is only compatible with the rewrite version, and is still in early alpha.
        It relies on pytest-asyncio for asynchronous test running, as discord.py is coroutine driven.

        dpytest can be used for projects using the default commands.Bot, or those defining their own subclass of bot.
        For someone using a custom class, code would look something like this:
        ```python
        import discord.ext.test as dpytest
        import yourbot
        import pytest
        
        
        @pytest.mark.asyncio
        async def test_bot():
            bot = yourbot.BotClass()
            
            # Load any extensions/cogs you want to in here
            
            dpytest.configure(bot)
            
            await dpytest.message("!help")
            dpytest.verify_message("[Expected help output]")
        ```
        
        The dpytest framework is designed to be used best with pytest style fixtures, but is technically framework agnostic.  
        With pytest, the bot setup step would be moved into a fixture so each test could use that fixture. Configure will ensure
        that all state is reset after each call.
