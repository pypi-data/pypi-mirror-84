class GameObservation:
    """
    Observation of the state of the game from a player's view. This is the same as the GameState, except that
    a player does not see the hands (cards) of the other players:
        - the dealer
        - the player that declared trump,
        - the trump chosen
        - trump was declared forehand (derived information)
        - the tricks that have been played so far
        - the winner and the first player (derived) of each trick
        - the number of points that have been made by the current jass_players team in this round
        - the number of points that have been made by the opponent team in this round
        - the number of cards played in the current trick
        - the cards played in the current trick
        - the current player
        - the hand of the player

     Similarly to game state, the GameObservation captures the information in the following stages of the game:
    - Cards have been dealt, but no trump is selected yet (and it is the player's turn to select trump)
    - The first player that is allowed to choose trump has passed this right to the partner, and it is the
    partners player's turn to select trump
    - Trump has been declared by either player from the team that declares trump, but no card has been played yet
    - Between 1 and 35 cards have been played

    The observation is usually from the point of view of the current player, but can also be from the point of view
    of another players. In that case, the hand array are the cards of that player. In order to distinguish between
    these cases, the variable GameObservation.player_view is used.
