    State of the game.

     A GameState object captures the information in the following stages of the game:
    - Cards have been dealt, but no trump is selected yet
    - The first player that is allowed to choose trump has passed this right to the partner (optional)
    - Trump has been declared by either player from the team that declares trump, but no card has been played yet
    - Between 1 and 35 cards have been played
    - The last card has been played, which is the end of the game.

    The class captures only the data without any logic how to change the data consistently.
