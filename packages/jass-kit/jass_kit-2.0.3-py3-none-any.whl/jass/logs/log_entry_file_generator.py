class LogEntryFileGenerator:
    """
    Create a file of log entries with each entry in a separate line of the file. Files are split to contain
    no more than the indicated max_entries lines. Entries are first collected into a buffer and (optionally) shuffled
    before writing.

    The entries are the dict that have be generated using the appropriate serializer for the classes.

    The class should be used as a context manager within "with" in python.
