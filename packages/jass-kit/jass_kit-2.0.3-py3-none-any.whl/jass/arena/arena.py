    Class for arenas. An arena plays a number of games between two pairs of players. The number of
    games to be played can be specified. The arena keeps statistics of the games won by each side and also
    of the point difference when winning.

    The class uses some strategy and template methods patterns. Currently, this is only done for dealing cards.
