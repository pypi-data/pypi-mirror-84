class GameRule:
    """
    Class for implementing rules of the jass game. The class includes rules that depend not on the process (like
    how trump is determined), but only upon cards. Currently this includes to determine the valid cards to play
    in a trick, to determine the winner of a trick and the points of a trick.

    This in an abstract base class that defines the interface.
