    Class for simulating a game. A game consists of selecting trump and playing 36 cards, currently the trump selection
    phase is implemented for Schieber. For other versions of the game regarding the order of actions, the class can be
    overridden. The actual rules of the game, points scoring, winning tricks and calculating which cards are allowed
    to be played are implemented in the rule class.
