Description: # welleng
        
        welleng aspires to be a collection of useful tools for Wells/Drilling Engineers, kicking off with a range of well trajectory analysis tools.
        
          - Generate survey listings and interpolation with minimum curvature
          - Calculate well bore uncertainty data (currently utilizing the ISCWSA MWD Rev4 model)
          - Calculate well bore clearance and Separation Factors (SF)
            - standard ISCWSA method
            - new mesh based method
        
        ## New Features!
        
          - Coming soon!
        
        ### Tech
        
        welleng uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
        
        * [trimesh] - awesome library for loading and using triangular meshes
        * [numpy] - the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
        * [scipy] - a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering
        * [dillinger] - open source editor used to generate this document
        
        ### Installation
        
        welleng requires [trimesh], [numpy] and [scipy] to run. Other libraries are optional depending on usage. Other than that, it should be an easy pip install to get up and running with welleng.
        
        ```sh
        $ pip install welleng
        ```
        
        ### Quick Start
        
        Coming soon, but in the meantime take a look at the [examples].
        
        ### Todos
        
         - Well trajectory planning - construct your own trajectories using a range of methods (and of course, including some novel ones)
         - Viewer - a 3D viewer to quickly visualize the data and results
         - More error models
