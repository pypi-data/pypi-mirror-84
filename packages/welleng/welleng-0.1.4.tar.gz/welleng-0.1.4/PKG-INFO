        [welleng] aspires to be a collection of useful tools for Wells/Drilling Engineers, kicking off with a range of well trajectory analysis tools.
        
          - Generate survey listings and interpolation with minimum curvature
          - Calculate well bore uncertainty data (currently utilizing the ISCWSA MWD Rev4 model)
          - Calculate well bore clearance and Separation Factors (SF)
            - standard ISCWSA method
            - new mesh based method using the [Flexible Collision Library]
        
        ## New Features!
        
          - **Mesh Based Collision Detection:** the current method for determining the Separation Factor between wells is constrained by the frequency and location of survey stations or necessitates interpolation of survey stations in order to determine if Anti-Collision Rules have been violated. Meshing the well bore inherrently interpolates between survey stations and as such is a more reliable method for identifying potential well bore collisions, especially wth more sparse data sets.
          - More coming soon!
        
        ### Tech
        
        [welleng] uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
        
        * [trimesh] - awesome library for loading and using triangular meshes
        * [numpy] - the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
        * [scipy] - a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering
        * [dillinger] - open source editor used to generate this document
        
        ### Installation
        
        [welleng] requires [trimesh], [numpy] and [scipy] to run. Other libraries are optional depending on usage and to get [python-fcl] running on which [trimesh] is built may require some additional installations. Other than that, it should be an easy pip install to get up and running with welleng and the minimum dependencies.
        
        ```sh
        $ pip install welleng
        ```
        
        ### Quick Start
        
        Coming soon, but in the meantime take a look at the [examples].
        
        ### Todos
        
         - Generate a scene of offset wells to enable fast screening of collision risks (e.g. hundreds of wells in seconds)
         - Well trajectory planning - construct your own trajectories using a range of methods (and of course, including some novel ones)
         - More error models
         - WebApp for those that just want answers
         - Viewer - a 3D viewer to quickly visualize the data and calculated results
        
        It's possible to generate data for visualizing well trajectories with [welleng], as can be seen with the rendered scenes below, but it can me made more simple and intuitive.
