== What to test? ==

Today's instalment of Fedora Test Day will focus on '''Printing'''.

This test day is for testing all aspects of printing, including setting up the printer, sharing printers on the network, and printing jobs.

The changes in Fedora 20 are relatively minor: switching to CUPS 1.7 and Ghostscript 9.10, and some improvements to cups-filters and the "Printers" part of GNOME Settings.

Note that since Fedora 19, printer sharing and discovery uses mDNS/DNS-SD rather than the CUPS Browsing method that's been the default in older releases.  The '''cups-browsed''' service provides backwards compatibility for CUPS Browsing/BrowsePoll.  One of the changes in Fedora 20 is for cups-browsed to use a more efficient method for BrowsePoll (asking for new/removed printers rather than fetching the entire list each time).

Remember that CUPS unit testing is only one small part of the story: printing is very much in need of '''integration''' testing. Try printing with different applications, using options you don't normally use in the print dialog. Try to see how many different ways you can break it!

If you see a problem and are not sure which component is to blame, [[Printing/Debugging|the Debugging Printing page]] can help you to diagnose it.

== Who's available ==

The following cast of characters will be available testing, workarounds, bug fixes, and general discussion ...
* Development - [[User:Twaugh|Tim Waugh]] (twaugh), [[User:Mkasik|Marek Kasik]] (mkasik), [[User:Jpopelka|Jiri Popelka]] (jpopelka)
* Quality Assurance - [[User:Psklenar|Petr Sklenar]] (psklenar)

== Prerequisite for Test Day == 

All you need is:

* An updated [http://fedoraproject.org/get-prerelease Fedora 20 pre-release]
* Access to a printer

== How to test? ==

First, make sure you have applied updates from the updates-testing repository.

* Configuring a printer not yet known to the system
* Printing a test page
* Printing something more complicated, e.g. LibreOffice document, PDF, email
* Taking advantage of extra print features of your printer e.g. duplexing, stapling

== Test Cases ==

Use the [http://testdays.qa.fedoraproject.org/testdays/show_event?event_id=13 TestDayApp] to view test case instructions and submit test results. When it asks you about your "Hardware", enter your printer make and model name.

{{admon/tip|Checking the Device ID is correctly listed|The hpijs, gutenprint-cups, foomatic-db-ppds and foomatic packages all contain tags that associate them with the Device IDs for the printers they support. If you are not given the opportunity to install one of these packages when your printer is supported by them, it may be that they do not list its Device ID correctly.  You can check this by running <code>/usr/share/system-config-printer/check-device-ids.py</code> as root.}}

== Test Results ==

If you have problems with any of the tests, report a bug to [https://bugzilla.redhat.com Bugzilla].  Choose the correct component:

* [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Fedora&version=19&component=gnome-settings-daemon gnome-settings-daemon] for problems relating to job reporting and printer status feedback in GNOME Shell
* [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Fedora&version=19&component=control-center control-center] for problems specific to printer administration in GNOME Shell e.g. the new system settings module
* [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Fedora&version=19&component=cups cups] for printing problems that persist even when using command line utilities such as '''lp'''
* [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Fedora&version=19&component=gtk2 gtk2] for printing problems common to all GTK+ applications using the GTK+ print dialog
* [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Fedora&version=19&component=system-config-printer system-config-printer] for bugs in the printing configuration program used in GNOME fallback mode and in other graphical environments
* [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Fedora&version=19&component=selinux-policy selinux-policy] if there is some selinux issues

If you see something unexpected, even if you are not entirely sure whether it's a bug, please take the time to report it as one.  Without doing that, it may be difficult to follow up and fix.
