    """Represents the 'test instance' concept for Wikitcms, where it
    is a result row from the tables used to contain results. We think
    of a "test instance" as the 'basic unit' of a single test for
    which some results are expected to be reported.

    The 'testcase' is the basic identifier of a ResultRow. It will
    not necessarily be unique, though - it is not uncommon for a set
    of ResultRows to have the same 'testcase' but a different 'name',
    which is the link text: there will a column which for each row
    contains [[testcase|name]], the testcase being the same but the
    name being different. Commonly the 'testcase' and 'name' will be
    the same, when each instance within a set has a different
    'testcase' the name should be identical to the testcase.

    milestone is, roughly, the priority of the test: it will usually
    be Basic, Beta or Final.

    results is required to be a dict of lists; the dict keys represent
    the test's environments. The values must be lists of instances of
    wikitcms.Result or a subclass of it.

    columns is the list of columns in the table in which the result
    was found (this is needed to figure out the environments for the
    results, as the envs are represented by table columns, and to know
    which cell to edit when modifying results).

    origtext is the text which was parsed to produce the instance, if
    it was produced by the from_wiki_row() class method which parses
    wiki text to produce instances.

    section and secid are the wiki page section in which the table
    from which the row came is located; though these are in a way
    attributes of the page, this is really another case where an MW
    attribute is just a way of encoding information about a *test*.
    The splitting of result pages into sections is a way of sub-
    grouping tests in each page. So it's appropriate to store those
    attributes here.

    At present you typically get ResultRow instances by calling a
    ComposePage's get_resultrows() method, which runs its text through
    result.find_resultrows(), which isolates the result rows in the
    wiki text and runs through through this class' from_wiki_row()
    method. This will always provide instances with a full set of
    the above-described attributes.
