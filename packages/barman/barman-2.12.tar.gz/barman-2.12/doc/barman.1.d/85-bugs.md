# BUGS

Barman has been extensively tested, and is currently being used in several
production environments. However, we cannot exclude the presence of bugs.

Any bug can be reported via the Sourceforge bug tracker. Along the bug submission,
users can provide developers with diagnostics information obtained through
the `barman diagnose` command.
