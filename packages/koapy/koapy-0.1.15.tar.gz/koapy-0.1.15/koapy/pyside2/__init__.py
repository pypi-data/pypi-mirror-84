# Entire errror message was like the followings:
#
#   qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "windows" in "" even though it was found.
#   This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.
#
#   Available platform plugins are: direct2d, minimal, offscreen, windows.
#
# I think this is happening due to anancodna environment,
# since Qt dlls are added to PATH under an ananconda environment.
