Configurations for your CoCalc project have been symlinked as described above.

If you use version control, then to get the most of the configuration,
please make sure that you set the following variables on your personal
computer, and forward them when you ssh to the project:

    # ~/.bashrc or similar
    LC_HG_USERNAME=Your Full Name <your.email.address+hg@gmail.com>
    LC_GIT_USEREMAIL=your.email.address+git@gmail.com
    LC_GIT_USERNAME=Your Full Name

To forward these, your SSH config file (~/.ssh/config) might look like:

    # ~/.ssh/config
    Host cc-project1
      User ff1cb986f...
    
    Host cc*
      HostName ssh.cocalc.com
      ForwardAgent yes
      SendEnv LC_HG_USERNAME
      SendEnv LC_GIT_USERNAME
      SendEnv LC_GIT_USEREMAIL
