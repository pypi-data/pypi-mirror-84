 Changes
=========

0.3.1:
  - Added `mmf_setup cocalc` initialization for CoCalc.com projects
    (changed from `mmf_setup smc`).
  - Add message to `nbinit()` call indicating that HGROOT has been added
    to `sys.path`.

0.3.0:
  - Support python 3 - drop support for python 2.
  - Conda installable from mforbes channel on anaconda cloud.
  - Add missing default.tex theme so that nbinit() brings in math
    definitions even if no theme is specified.
  - Fixed KeyError: 'asyncio' error on failed IPython import.

0.1.13:
  - Incomplete version... everything here is rolled into 0.3.0

0.1.12:
  - Made `mmf_initial_setup` python 3 compliant.
  - Added logging to nbinit() and made some slight tweaks to HGROOT.
  - Added \D, \sn, \cn, \dn commands for mathjax.
  
0.1.11:
  - Resolve issue #20:

    - `mmf_setup.set_path.set_path_from_file` allows for configuration of path
      in `setup.cfg` file.
    - Fix python 3 bug: TypeError: Can't mix strings and bytes in path components
	
0.1.10:
  - Added better backwards compatibility for previous changes.
  - Simplified nbinit theme management and use 'default' theme as default.

    - New themes only need to overwrite what they need.
    - Don't change fonts as default since this does not work well on CoCalc (the
      code cells change size on clicking which is a pain.)

0.1.9:
  - Resolve issues:

    - #17: store mmf_setup.HGROOT
    - #18: safer exception handling with nbclean commands so data is not lost
    - #19: nbclean works with new mercurial API
      
  - Added \erfi, \sech, \Braket
  - `import mmf_setup.set_path.hgroot` will add HGROOT to path without IPython
  - Added standalone nbinit.py for use without mmf_setup installs.

0.1.8:
  - Resolves issue #15.
  - Use $BASH_SOURCE{0} to get BIN_DIR (resolves issue #16)
  - Added nbinit(hgroot) option to add `hg root` to `sys.path` (issue #13)

0.1.7:
  - Changed option to --clean-all (resolves issue #7)
  - Updated the notebook style (added \Tr, fixed output overflow issue)
  - Added pip option mmf_setup[nbextensions]
  - Removed 'EnableNBExtensionApp' dependence which broke new Jupyter (resolves
    issue #12)
  - Added some files for initializing setup on Sage Mathcloud (SMC) (resolves
    issue #14).

    - Added mmf_initial_setup script and some init files (.inputrc, .hgrc,
      .bash_aliases).
    - Run with `mmf_setup smc`
      
  - Removed old extension manager since nbextensions are quite good now.

0.1.6:
  - Added cupdate command (resolves issue #4)
  - Fixed bug with ccommit where it did not accept a list of files
    (issue #6)
  - Issue commands in a context to provide a robust mechanism for
    recovery (issue #5)
