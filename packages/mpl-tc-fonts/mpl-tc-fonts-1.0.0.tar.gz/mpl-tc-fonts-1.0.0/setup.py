    # This field adds keywords for your project which will appear on the

    # When your source code is in a subdirectory under the project root, e.g.
    # `src/`, it is necessary to specify the `package_dir` argument.
    package_dir={'': 'src'},  # Optional

    # You can just specify package directories manually here if your project is
    # simple. Or you can use find_packages().
    #
    # Alternatively, if you just want to distribute a single Python file, use
    # the `py_modules` argument instead as follows, which will expect a file
    # called `my_module.py` to exist:
    #
    #   py_modules=["my_module"],
    #
    packages=find_packages(where='src'),  # Required

    # Specify which Python versions you support. In contrast to the

    # syntax, for example:
    #
    #   $ pip install sampleproject[dev]

    # Similar to `install_requires` above, these must be valid existing

    # Although 'package_data' is the preferred approach, in some case you may
    # need to place data files outside of your packages. See:
    # http://docs.python.org/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files

    # To provide executable scripts, use entry points in preference to the
    # "scripts" keyword. Entry points provide cross-platform support and allow
    # `pip` to create the appropriate form of executable for the target
    # platform.
    #
    # For example, the following would provide a command called `sample` which
    # executes the function `main` from this package when invoked:
    # entry_points={  # Optional

    # issues, where the source is hosted, where to say thanks to the package
    # maintainers, and where to support the project financially. The key is
    # what's used to render the link text on PyPI.
