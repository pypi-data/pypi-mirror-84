#MMM: made these functional changes... and no others!
 - provide dill as alternate install to cPickle in forking.py and processing.c
   . (this allows processing to unpickle with dill)

#MMM: made these "build" changes
 - edited __init__.py to have __version__ = '0.52.1'
 - edited setup.py to use my download_url
