Installation
============

The package is installed from PyPI with::

    $ pip install pyodc


System dependencies
-------------------

The package contains two different implementations of the same library.

pyodc is a pure-python encoder and decoder for ODB2 data, which encodes data
from, and decodes it into pandas dataframes.

codc is an implementation of the same API as pyodc that depends on the ECMWF
*odc* library. This must be complied and installed on the system and made
available to python (through the CFFI mechanism) as a shared library. This
may involve adding its location to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.

The odc library may be found at https://github.com/ecmwf/odc
