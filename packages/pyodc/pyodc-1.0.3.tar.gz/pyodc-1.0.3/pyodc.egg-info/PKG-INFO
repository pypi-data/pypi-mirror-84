Description: 
        Installation
        ============
        
        The package is installed from PyPI with::
        
            $ pip install pyodc
        
        
        System dependencies
        -------------------
        
        The package contains two different implementations of the same library.
        
        pyodc is a pure-python encoder and decoder for ODB2 data, which encodes data
        from, and decodes it into pandas dataframes.
        
        codc is an implementation of the same API as pyodc that depends on the ECMWF
        *odc* library. This must be complied and installed on the system and made
        available to python (through the CFFI mechanism) as a shared library. This
        may involve adding its location to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.
        
        The odc library may be found at https://github.com/ecmwf/odc
