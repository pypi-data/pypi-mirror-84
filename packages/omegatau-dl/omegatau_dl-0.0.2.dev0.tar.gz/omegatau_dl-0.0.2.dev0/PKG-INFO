Description: # Requirements
        
        `Python 3` and `pip` for Python 3.
        
        # Usage
        
        Use `pip` to install this package
        ```
        pip install omegatau-dl
        pip3 install omegatau-dl
        ```
        depending on your OS and Python version supported by `pip`.
        On most Linux distributions `python`/`pip` refers to Python 2 and `python3`/`pip3` to Python 3.
        
        Then run the script with
        ```
        python -m omegatau_dl
        python3 -m omegatau_dl
        ```
        depending on your OS.
        
        The script will download all numbered episodes into the same folder.
        It won't redownload existing episodes.
        It **does not** support continuation of download, so if you stop in the middle of a download delete that (incomplete) file. 
        The numbers of all downloaded episodes will all be converted to 4 digit numbers.
