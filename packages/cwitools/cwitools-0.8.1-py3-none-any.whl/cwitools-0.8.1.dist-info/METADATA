CWITools Documentation on ReadTheDocs
-------------------------------------
https://cwitools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

General Description
-------------------
CWITools is a Python3 package developed to help CWI observers crop, coadd, and analyze their data. It has several command-line utilities (which require no Python knowledge to use!) and can also be used within the Python3 environment (e.g. `from cwitools import coordinates`.)

The packge is currently in its first official beta release - and a paper is in the works! Please report bugs here on GitHub, or email me if you need help at dosulliv@caltech.edu.

Installation
------------

CWITools is available from the Python Package Index (PyPI) via pip, and can be installed with `pip install cwitools` or by downloading this GitHub repository and running `python3 setup.py install` from the main directory. I am working on uploading the package to the Anaconda cloud.
