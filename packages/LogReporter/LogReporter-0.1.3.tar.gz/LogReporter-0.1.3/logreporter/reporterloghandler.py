      Maximum number of characters requested.

    report: func(text) -> bool or None
      A function for reporting.
      If you set a function object here, this function will be called just before extracting the log text and saving the extracted text.
      The character string itself extracted from the log is stored as a parameter.

      The function also returns a bool value as a return value.
      If false is returned, it is considered as a report failure and the text extraction process is not committed.
