class ProcessRunner(Thread):
    """Thread that 'manages' a Plugin process.

    A runner will take care of creating and starting a process that will run the
    plugin entry point.

    Logging here is a little interesting. We expect that plugins will be created as the
    first order of business in the plugin's ``main()``. Part of the Plugin initialize
    is asking beer-garden for a logging configuration, so anything after that point will
    be handled according to the returned configuration.

    However, there are two potential problems: the plugin may have logging calls before
    initializing the Plugin (even though it's not recommended), and the Plugin may fail
    to register at all for whatever reason.

    Both of these cases are handled the same way. We read STDOUT and STDERR from the
    process, and everything gets placed into a queue. The queue won't be processed until
    one of two things happen:
        - The ``associate`` method is called. This means that the plugin has
        successfully registered
        - The plugin process dies

    Once either of those happen we check to see if there are any items on the logging
    queue. If so, we prepend a message saying what's about to happen, and then we log
    all messages. Messages will be logged according to the normal application config
    as well as a special error file in the plugin log directory. This error file will
    be overwritten every time the plugin is run.

    Two support this slightly odd setup this class has two loggers:
    - logger is the normal python logger for this class
    - capture_logger is the logger used to log records coming from the plugin process
