Keep your github CODEOWNERS file up to date.


* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://gitown.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

* Keep your github ``CODEOWNERS`` file up to date.
* If a committer exceeds the ``ownership_threshold`` percentage in a file, then the committer is added to the ``CODEOWNERS`` file.
* Default ``ownership_threshold`` is set to 25%. You can change it by passing ``--ownership_threshold``
* Can be used as a ``pre-commit`` hook.
* You need to create a gitownrc_ file and have a mapping of github emails to github usernames. gitown reads that file and only those users are considered to be added to the ``CODEOWNERS`` file.*

It is best used along with pre-commit_. You can use it along with pre-commit by adding the following hook in your ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` file.

::

    repos:
    - repo:  https://github.com/milin/gitown
      rev: v0.1.0
      hooks:
      - id:  gitown
        args: ['--ownership_threshold=50', '--codeowners_filename=CODEOWNERS']  # Optional


You need to have precommit setup to use this hook.
--------------------------------------------------
   Install Pre-commit and the commit-msg hook-type.


   ::

        pip install pre-commit
        pre-commit install
