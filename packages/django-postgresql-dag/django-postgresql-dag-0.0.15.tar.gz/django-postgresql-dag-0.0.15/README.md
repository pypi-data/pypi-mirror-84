# Django & Postgresql-based Directed Acyclic Graphs

The main distinguishing factor for this project is that it can retrieve entire sections of a graph with far
fewer queries than most other packages. The trade off is portability: it uses Postgres' Common Table
Expressions (CTE) to achieve this and is therefore not compatible with other databases.

NOTE: Not all methods which would benefit from CTEs use them yet.

NOTE: This project is a work in progress. While functional, it is not optimized. Currently, it provides numerous
methods for retrieving nodes, and a few for retrieving edges within the graph. In progress are filters within the
in order to limit the area of the graph to be searched.

## Most Simple Example:

### models.py

    from django.db import models
    from django_postgresql_dag.models import node_factory, edge_factory

    class NetworkEdge(edge_factory("NetworkNode", concrete=False)):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

        def __str__(self):
            return self.name

        def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
            self.name = f"{self.parent.name} {self.child.name}"
            super().save(*args, **kwargs)


    class NetworkNode(node_factory(NetworkEdge)):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

        def __str__(self):
            return self.name

### Add some Instances via the Shell (or in views, etc)

    ~/myapp$ python manage.py shell
    >>> from myapp.models import NetworkNode, NetworkEdge
    
    >>> root = NetworkNode.objects.create(name="root")
    
    >>> a1 = NetworkNode.objects.create(name="a1")
    >>> a2 = NetworkNode.objects.create(name="a2")
    >>> a3 = NetworkNode.objects.create(name="a3")
    
    >>> b1 = NetworkNode.objects.create(name="b1")
    >>> b2 = NetworkNode.objects.create(name="b2")
    >>> b3 = NetworkNode.objects.create(name="b3")
    >>> b4 = NetworkNode.objects.create(name="b4")
    
    >>> c1 = NetworkNode.objects.create(name="c1")
    >>> c2 = NetworkNode.objects.create(name="c2")
    
    >>> root.add_child(a1)
    >>> root.add_child(a2)
    >>> a3.add_parent(root)  # You can add from either side of the relationship
    
    >>> b1.add_parent(a1)
    >>> a1.add_child(b2)
    >>> a2.add_child(b2)
    >>> a3.add_child(b3)
    >>> a3.add_child(b4)
    
    >>> b3.add_child(c2)
    >>> b3.add_child(c1)
    >>> b4.add_child(c1)

### Resulting Database Tables

     6  | b2
     7  | b3
     8  | b4
     9  | c1
     10 | c2

#### myapp_networkedge

    id  | child_id | parent_id | name
    ----+----------+-----------+---------
     1  |       2  |         1 | root a1
     2  |       3  |         1 | root a2
     3  |       4  |         1 | root a3

     7  |       7  |         4 | a3 b3
     8  |       8  |         4 | a3 b4
     9  |       10 |         7 | b3 c2
     10 |       9  |         7 | b3 c1

### Work with the Graph in the Shell (or in views, etc)

    ~/myapp$ python manage.py shell

    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    >>> root.descendants_and_self_ids()

## ToDo

- Describe methods of filtering nodes and edges within the CTE.
