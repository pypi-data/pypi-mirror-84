        ## Installation
        Install from pypi
        ```bash
        pip install pyxwb2
        ```
        
        Install locally
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/minsis/pyxwb2.git
        cd pyxwb2
        pip install .
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        There are two separate libraries to use here: one fro loading XWS import data 
        and one for loading the entire xwing-data pack for usage in an app or web app, etc
        
        ### XWS Data Load
        To load and validate an XWB json file you can load it in. With a basic XWS load you get
        a full manifest of data for the pilots included.
        
        ```python
        from pyxwb2 import XwingSquadron
        
        squadron = XwingSquadron()
        squadron.import_squad("xws-squad.json")
        ```
        
        As per the XWS standard point costs are ignored on import and loaded from the manifest.
        If the source is trusted then the json schema is ignored.
        
        To load trusted data
        ```python
        from pyxwb2 import XwingSquadron
        
        squadron = XwingSquadron(trust_source=True)
        squadron.import_squad("xws-squad.json")
        ```
        
        ### X-wing Data Pack
        This loads the entire manifest data from xwing-data. Gives you access to the entire data
        strcutre that it has to offer.
        
        ```python
        from pyxwb2 import XwingDataPack
        
        data = XwingDataPack()
        ```
