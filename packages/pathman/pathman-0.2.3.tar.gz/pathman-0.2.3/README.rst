Pathman
=======

Pathman is a utility for interacting with files using a uniform interface
regardless of where the files live: locally, on S3, or in some other remote
service. The interface attempts to closely follow the `pathlib` interface when
possible. Support for interacting with files in S3 is done through heavy use of
the s3fs_ library.
