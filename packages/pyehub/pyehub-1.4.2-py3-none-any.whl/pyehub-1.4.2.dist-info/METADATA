PyHub
=====

A program to solve an energy hub model in Python.

Requirements
------------

- Python 3.7.3
- pip for Python 3.7.3
- `GLPK` or another solver supported by PyLP

Running a Model
---------------

To run a energy hub model, use the `General_input.xlsx` file to enter your data.
The data **must** be in the same format.

Check the `config.yaml` file to see if the input file and output file is where
you want to load and output the results of the model respectively.

While inside the `config.yaml` file, be sure to set the settings for using a
specific solver that is installed on your system.
The default one is `glpk` with some options, but you can set it to any other
solver that is supported by PyLP.

Once you have configured the `config.yaml` file, run:
```
python run.py
```
to solve the model.
The results should be in the file you specified in `config.yaml`.

Development
