    Solve the linear programming problem.

        objective: The objective function
        constraints: The collection of constraints
        minimize: True for minimizing; False for maximizing
        solver: The solver to use. Current supports 'glpk', 'theo-cluster' and 'cplex'.
        verbose: If True, output the results of the solver
        options list: add options to the (glpk) solver
