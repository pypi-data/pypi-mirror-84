HAL_9000 is a Neural Network library that offers various tools for Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning tasks.

Workflow of this library is inspired by Tensorflow's Keras.

As of now, HAL_9000 has 6 different operations:

    1. Perceptron
    2. Multilayer Perceptron
    3. Fully connected/Dense Neural Network
    4. Convolutional Neural Network
    5. Deep Q Neural Network
    6. NeuroEvolution
