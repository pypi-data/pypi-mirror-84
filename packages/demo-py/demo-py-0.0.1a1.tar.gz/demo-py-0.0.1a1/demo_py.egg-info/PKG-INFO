Description: # perf-py
        
        A library that personally helps me understand the performance of common python code (and in turn, it might help you understand it too!)

        # Todo
        - [ ] Does mapping over an iterator perform better than using generators?
        - [ ] Does chunking a generator affect performance?
        - [ ] Does composing generators affect performance? 
        - [x] Make a table of the performance of each function ...
            - [x] Open this up in a notebook!
