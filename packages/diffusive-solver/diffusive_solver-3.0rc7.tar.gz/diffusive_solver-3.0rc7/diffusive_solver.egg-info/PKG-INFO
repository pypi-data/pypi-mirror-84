        ## Project description
        
        Package for solving systems of coupled diffusion equations using Finite
        Element Method (FEM). 
        This package is based on FeniCS project https://fenicsproject.org/.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Diffusive_solvers requires FEniCS. Please refer to the FEmiCS installation
        page https://fenicsproject.org/download/
        
        ## Examples
        
        Please refer to the project repository 
        https://gitlab.com/itorre/diffusive_solver for example notebooks.
