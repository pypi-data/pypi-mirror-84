# Diffusive_solver

## Project description

Package for solving systems of coupled diffusion equations using Finite
Element Method (FEM). 
This package is based on FeniCS project https://fenicsproject.org/.

## Installation

Diffusive_solvers requires FEniCS. Please refer to the FEmiCS installation
page https://fenicsproject.org/download/

## Examples

Please refer to the project repository 
https://gitlab.com/itorre/diffusive_solver for example notebooks.
