Description: py-scfg
        =======
        
        A Python module to parse `scfg <https://git.sr.ht/~emersion/scfg>`__
        formatted configuration files.
        
        It's a simple port of the Go module
        `go-scfg <https://git.sr.ht/~emersion/go-scfg>`__.
        
        **Note:** Not to be confused with
        `pyscfg <https://pypi.org/project/pyscfg/>`__ which appears to parse
        configurations into and out of YAML files.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Very simple:
        
        ::
        
            import scfg
        
            conf = scfg.Config("~/your_config.conf")
            conf.load()
            train = conf.get("train")
            train_models = train.get_all("model")
            trail_models[0].get("lines-served")
