    Ideal op amp is an approximate analysis, but most modern amplifiers have such large gain and input impedances that the approximate analysis is a good one.

    Characteristics:

    An infinite resistance between the input terminals implies that an open circuit exists there
    and current cannot enter the op amp. But the output current is not necessarily zero.
