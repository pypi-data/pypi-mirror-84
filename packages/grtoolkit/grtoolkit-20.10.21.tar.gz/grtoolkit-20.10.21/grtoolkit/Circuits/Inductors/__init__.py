# Designed to store energy in its magnetic field.
# Consists of a coil of inducting wire

# An inductor acts like a short circuit to DC.
# The current through an inductor cannot change instantaneously.


# A discontinuous change in the current through an inductor requires an infinite voltage, which is not physically possible.

# The ideal capacitor, the ideal inductor does not dissipate energy. The energy stored in it can be retrieved at a later time.

# A practical, nonideal inductor has a significant resistive component.
# This resistance is called the winding resistance (R_w) , and
# it appears in series with the inductance of the inductor.
# R_w is usually very small and can be ignored at high frequencies.

# The nonideal inductor also has a winding capacitance (C_w)
# due to the capacitive coupling between the conducting coils.
# C_w is usually negligible except at high frequencies.
