#Designed to store energy in its electric field.

# Capacitors do not dissipate, but store or release energy
# Capacitors are used to block dc, pass ac, shift phase, store energy, start motors, and suppress noise.
# A capacitor is an open circuit to dc
# The voltage across a capacitor must be continuous. It cannot cange abruptly.
# The capacitor resists an abrupt change in voltage across it.
# It is not physically possible for the capacitor voltage to take the form
# Conversely, the current through a capacitor can change instantaneously.
# The ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy. It takes power from
# the circuit when storing energy in its field and returns previously
# stored energy when delivering power to the circuit.
# A real, nonideal capacitor has a parallel-model leakage resistance.
# The leakage resistance may be as high as 100 MOhms and can be neglected for most practical applications.
