"""SPI modes and speeds for all used chips

Lists all the used chips so far with the corresponding SPI mode and speeds.
Necessary for setting the chip select in the SPI Rack

The speeds are set by a divisor: 84MHz/value (range 14..255), these are the
numbers in the list below. Zero is a special value which sets the SPI speed to
5kHz (software SPI)
