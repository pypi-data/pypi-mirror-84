        ## About the Project
        
        Synthetig is a project to make an open source synthetic data generation platform. 
        It is a comprehensive platform that will make the process of generating synthetic data simple, which the user can trust.
        
        ## Installing
        
        The easiest way to install Synthetig is by pip install:
        
        ```
        $ pip install synthetig
        ```
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        Generating your first synthetic data set:
        
        ```
        $ python
        ```
        
        ```
        >>> from synthetig import Model 
        >>> from synthetig.example import load_data
        >>> ctgan = Model.CTGAN()
        >>> real_data = load_data()
        >>> ctgam.fit(real_data)
        >>> synthetic_data  = ctgan.smaple(number_of_samples=2000)
        
        ```
        ## How to Get Involved  
        
        We would love for you to get involved in anyway you can, at Synthetig we are an open house so anyone is welcome.
