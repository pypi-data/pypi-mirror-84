``fbc_curation``: Reproducibility of constraint-based models
available from 
`https://github.com/matthiaskoenig/fbc_curation <https://github.com/matthiaskoenig/fbc_curation>`_.

This repository creates standardized reference files for a given FBC model based on cobrapy and glpk. These files can be used in the model curation process for validating the model behavior. The format of the standardized reference files is described below. 
Currently two separate implementations of the reference files are included in the package:

* ``cobrapy`` based on COBRApy (Constraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis in Python) available from `https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy <https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy>`_
* ``cameo`` based on Cameo (Cameo—Computer Aided Metabolic Engineering and Optimization) available from `https://github.com/biosustain/cameo <https://github.com/biosustain/cameo>`_


``fbc_curation`` is a python package which can be included in python applications. In addition a command line tool is provided which allows easy usage outside of python.

The documentation is available on `https://fbc-curation.readthedocs.io <https://fbc-curation.readthedocs.io>`__.
If you have any questions or issues please `open an issue <https://github.com/matthiaskoenig/fbc_curation/issues>`__.
