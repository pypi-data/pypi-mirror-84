        Do stuff with python
        
        Automate stuff and save time.
        
        Similar to make. In make you write stuff in shell, in do, you write in python.
        
        `pip install ado-py`
        
        write a file do.py in your directory
        
        write functions in it
        
        call any function by running `ado func` in the terminal
        
        running only `ado` would print the docstring of do.py
