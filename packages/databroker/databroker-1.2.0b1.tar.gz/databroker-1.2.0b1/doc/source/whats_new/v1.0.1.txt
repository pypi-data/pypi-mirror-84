-------------------

Added

  configuration file, the ``root_map`` values may be given as *relative* paths
  interpreted relative to the location of that configuration file.

Changed
+++++++

* The minimum version of the dependency ``intake`` has been increased to
  ``v0.5.5`` and various internal changes have been made to adjust for changes
  in ``intake``.

Fixed
+++++

* The object :class:`~databroker.utils.LazyMap` object now support pickling.
* The query :class:`~databroker.queries.TimeRange` now properly propagates its

* If installation with ``python2`` is attempted, a helpful error message is
  shown.
