v0.10.0 (2018-02-20)
--------------------

Enhancements
++++++++++++

* Add special name ``Broker.named('temp')`` which creates new, temporary
  storage each time it is called. This is convenient for testing and teaching.

Deprecations
++++++++++++

* The :meth:`Broker.__call__` method for searching headers by metadata accepted
  special keyword arguments, ``start_time`` and/or ``end_time``, which filtered
  results by RunStart time. These names proved to be confusing, so they have
  been renamed ``since`` and ``until`` (terminology inspired by ``git log``).
  The original names still work, but warn if used.

Bug Fixes
+++++++++

* The mongoquery backend returned identical references (i.e. the same
  dictionary) on subsequent queries, meaning that mutations could propagate
  across results sets.
* Ensure there is only one definition of a ``DuplicateHandler`` exception.
* Remove invalid keyword argument from ``get_images``.
