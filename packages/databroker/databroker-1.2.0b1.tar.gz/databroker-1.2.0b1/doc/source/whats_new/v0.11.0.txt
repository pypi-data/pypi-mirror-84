v0.11.0 (2018-05-14)
--------------------

Enhancements
++++++++++++

* Broker objects now have a ``db.name`` attribute which is the name passed into
  ``Broker.named`` or ``None``.
* Header objects now an ``ext`` attribute, containing a ``SimpleNamespace``. By
  default, it is empty. It is intended to be used to pull metadata from
  external data sources, such as sample metadata, comments or tags, or proposal
  information. To register a datasource, add an item to the dictionary
  ``Broker.external_fetchers``. The value, which should be a callable, will be
  passed two arguments, the RunStart document and RunStop document, and the
  result will be added to ``ext`` using the key. The callable is expected to
  handle all special cases (errors, etc.) internally and return ``None`` if it
  has nothing to add.
* Accept Resource and Datum documents via the generic ``insert`` method. To
  facilitate the "asset refactor" transition in bluesky and ophyd, ignore
  duplicate attempts to insert a document with the same ``uid``. (This is
  controllable by a new flag ``ignore_duplicate_error`` on the Registry insert
  methods.)

Bug Fixes
+++++++++

* The ``Header.fields()`` method wrongly ignored its ``stream_name`` argument.
