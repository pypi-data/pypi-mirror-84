v0.9.1 (2017-09-06)
-------------------

This is release contains small but important bug fixes. It is recommended that
all users upgrade from v0.9.0.

Bug Fixes
+++++++++

* Respect the ``fill`` kwargs in :meth:`Header.table` and
  :meth:`Broker.get_table`. In v0.9.0, a regression was introduced that always
  set it to ``True`` regardless of the user input.
* Omit the special value ``'_legacy_config'`` from the results returned by
  :func:`list_configs` because it should a (private) synonym for one of the
  other values.
* Make document retrieval lazy (as it was intended to be) by removing an
  internal call to ``check_fields_exist``.
* Do not attempt to fill external data that has already been filled.
