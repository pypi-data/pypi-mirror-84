class Cyclic2D(CellType):
    """
    As with any cellular automaton, the cyclic cellular automaton consists of a regular grid of cells
     in one or more dimensions. The cells can take on any of {\displaystyle n}n states,
     ranging from {\displaystyle 0}{\displaystyle 0} to {\displaystyle n-1}n-1. The first
     generation starts out with random states in each of the cells. In each subsequent generation,
      if a cell has a neighboring cell whose value is the successor of the cell's value,
      the cell is "consumed" and takes on the succeeding value.
      (Note that {\displaystyle 0}{\displaystyle 0} is the successor of {\displaystyle n-1}n-1; see also modular arithmetic.)
      More general forms of this type of rule also include a threshold parameter, and only allow a cell to be
      consumed when the number of neighbors with the successor value exceeds this threshold.
