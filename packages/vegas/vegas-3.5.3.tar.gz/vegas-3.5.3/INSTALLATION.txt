To install:

1. Use 'make install' to install in the system library (or use
	'make install-user' to install in user's library.) Python modules
	numpy and gvar are installed automatically if not present.

	N.B. Rather than using make and the makefile, one can instead use
	standard python installation tools: run 'pip install .' to install
	to the system library (or 'pip install . --user' to install to
	the user's directory) from within the top directory.

	N.B. If you have previously installed older versions of vegas,
	consider removing the earlier modules to make sure that the new ones are
	used by Python. This will not be a problem if the new modules overwrite
	the older ones, but could cause trouble if the new modules are written
	to a different place. Find out where the older modules are stored by
	using 'pydoc vegas' before installing the new software
	(pydoc lists the location of the module under "FILE").

	N.B. vegas uses cython to convert .pyx files to .c files. The .c files
	are included in the distribution so cython is not required to install
	gvar. To force regeneration of the .c files set USE_CYTHON=True in
	setup.py.

	Install Python matplotlib if you want to make pictures of the
	vegas grid. Install mpi4py (and MPI itself) for multi-processor
	evaluation of integrands. Neither of these packages is installed
	automatically.

	pip is used for installing (and uninstalling) vegas. pip usually
	comes with python.

	The vegas code works for Python 2.7 and 3.3-3.6. It has not been tested
	for earlier versions.

2. (Optional) Run 'make tests' to test your installation of vegas.
	The tests have been successful if the output ends with "OK".
	Some tests involve random numbers and so may occasionally --- less than
	1 in 100 runs --- fail due to rare multi-sigma fluctuations; rerun the
	tests if they do fail. Contact g.p.lepage@cornell.edu if there are
	persistent, frequent failures.

	N.B. The tests can also be run directly using Python's unittest module:
	"python -m unittest discover".

4. (Optional) Change to subdirectory examples/ and look at some of the
 	sample .py files given there that use vegas. Run them one by one ---
	"python simple.py" etc --- or all at once using "make run".

5. (Optional) Use 'make clean' to erase work files/directories.


To uninstall:

1. 'make uninstall' uninstalls what was installed. It uses pip uninstall.
