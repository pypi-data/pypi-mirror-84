Contains the PennyLane Forest plugin. This plugin allows three Rigetti devices to work with
PennyLane --- the wavefunction simulator, the Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM), and Quantum Processing
Units (QPUs).

`pyQuil <https://pyquil.readthedocs.io>`_ is a Python library for quantum programming using the
quantum instruction language (Quil) --- resulting quantum programs can be executed using the
`Rigetti Forest SDK <https://www.rigetti.com/forest>`_ and the `Rigetti QCS
<https://www.rigetti.com/qcs>`_.

`PennyLane <https://pennylane.ai>`_ is a machine learning library for optimization and automatic
differentiation of hybrid quantum-classical computations.


Features
========

* Provides four devices to be used with PennyLane: ``forest.numpy_wavefunction``, ``forest.wavefunction``, ``forest.qvm``, and ``forest.qpu``. These provide access to the pyQVM Numpy wavefunction simulator, Forest wavefunction simulator, quantum virtual machine (QVM), and quantum processing unit (QPU) respectively.


* All provided devices support all core qubit PennyLane operations and observables.


* Provides custom PennyLane operations to cover additional pyQuil operations: ``T``, ``S``, ``ISWAP``, ``CCNOT``, ``PSWAP``, and many more. Every custom operation supports analytic differentiation.

* Combine Forest and the Rigetti Cloud Services with PennyLane's automatic differentiation and optimization.


Installation
============

PennyLane-Forest requires both PennyLane and pyQuil. It can be installed via ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m pip install pennylane-forest


Getting started
===============

Once the PennyLane-Forest plugin is installed, the three provided pyQuil devices can be accessed straight away in PennyLane.

You can instantiate these devices for PennyLane as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    import pennylane as qml
    dev_numpy = qml.device('forest.numpy_wavefunction', wires=2)
    dev_simulator = qml.device('forest.wavefunction', wires=2)
    dev_pyqvm = qml.device('forest.qvm', device='2q-pyqvm', shots=1000)
    dev_qvm = qml.device('forest.qvm', device='2q-qvm', shots=1000)
    dev_qpu = qml.device('forest.qpu', device='Aspen-8', shots=1000)

These devices can then be used just like other devices for the definition and evaluation of QNodes within PennyLane. For more details, see the `plugin usage guide <https://pennylane-forest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>`_ and refer to the PennyLane documentation.
