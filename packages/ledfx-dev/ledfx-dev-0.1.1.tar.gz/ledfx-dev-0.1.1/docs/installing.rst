============================
   Installation and Setup
============================

LedFx is a network controller that aims to enable synchronization of multiple lights across a network.
LedFx doesn't currently support local control of LED strings, so you need a separate device
(e.g., ESP8266/ESP32) to control the LEDs directly. To be able to add your LED strips to LedFx your device
needs to be capable of receiving data either via the E1.31 sACN protocol or a generic (simple)
UDP protocol. See below for a list of tested ESP8266 firmware that can be used with LedFx.

Here is everything you need to get started with LedFx:

    #. A Computer (or Raspberry Pi) with Python >= 3.6 (Anaconda_ is recommended on Windows)
    #. An E1.31 capable device with addressiable LEDs connected

        - Commercial grade DMX controllers
        - ESP8266 modules can be purchased for as little as $2 USD from Aliexpress

Here is a list of tested ESP8266 firmware that works with LedFx:

    - ESPixelStick_ is a great E1.31 based firmware
    - `Scott's Audio Reactive Firmware`_ which inspired this project!
    - WLED_ has lots of firmware effects and supports E1.31 and UDP

Windows Installation
--------------------

To get started on Windows it is highly recommended that you use Anaconda_ to make installation of Cython components easier.

Please see :ref:`this page <win-alt-install>` for alternative installation instructions for Windows.

**1.** Create a `conda virtual environment <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html>`_ (this step is optional but highly recommended):

.. code:: doscon

    > conda create -n ledfx
    > conda activate ledfx

**2.** Install LedFx and all the dependencies using pip and the conda package manager:

.. code:: doscon

    > conda config --add channels conda-forge
    > conda install aubio portaudio pywin32
    > conda install -c anaconda pyaudio
    > pip install ledfx

**3.** Launch LedFx with the ``--open-ui`` option to launch the browser:

.. code:: doscon

    > ledfx --open-ui

Linux Installation
------------------

To install on Linux first ensure you have at least Python 3.6 installed (alternatively use Anaconda_).

**1.** Install LedFx and all the dependencies using apt-get and pip:

.. code:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
    $ pip install ledfx

**2.** Launch LedFx with the ``open-ui`` option to launch the browser:

.. code:: console

    $ ledfx --open-ui

macOS Installation
------------------

To install on macOS first ensure you have at least Python 3.6 installed (alternatively use `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_).

**1.** Install LedFx and all the dependencies using homebrew and pip:

.. code:: console

    $ brew install portaudio
    $ pip install ledfx

**2.** Launch LedFx with the ``open-ui`` option to launch the browser:

.. code:: console

    $ ledfx --open-ui

**1.** Alternatively, create a `conda virtual environment <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html>`_:

.. code:: console

    $ conda create -n ledfx python=3.7
    $ conda activate ledfx

**2.** Install LedFx and all the dependencies using pip and the conda package manager.

.. code:: console

    $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
    $ conda install aubio portaudio
    $ pip install ledfx

**3.** Launch LedFx with the ``open-ui`` option to launch the browser:

.. code:: console

    $ ledfx --open-ui
