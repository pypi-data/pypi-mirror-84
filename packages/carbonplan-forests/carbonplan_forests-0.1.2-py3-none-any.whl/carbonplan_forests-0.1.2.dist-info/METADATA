This repository includes our libraries and scripts for mapping forest carbon potential and risks.

## install

```shell
pip install carbonplan[forests]
```

## usage

This codebase is organized into modules that implement data loading and model fitting as well as utitlies for plotting and other common tasks. Most anlayses involve some combination of the `load` and `fit` modules.

There are four scripts in the `scripts` folder that use these tools to import data, run models, and parse results.

- `biomass.py`
- `fire.py`
- `drought.py`
- `insects.py`

And there are two additional scripts `regrid.py` and `convert.py` for converting the results to zarr files for storage and geojson for visualization purposes.

Several notebooks are additionally provided that show the use of these tools for fitting models and inspecting model outputs. Notebooks are organized by the model type, e.g. `biomass`, `fire`, etc.
