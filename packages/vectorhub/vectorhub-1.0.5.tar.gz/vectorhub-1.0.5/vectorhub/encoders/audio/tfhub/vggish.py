    description="""An audio event embedding model trained on the YouTube-8M dataset.
VGGish should be used:
- as a high-level feature extractor: the 128-D embedding output of VGGish can be used as the input features of another shallow model which can then be trained on a small amount of data for a particular task. This allows quickly creating specialized audio classifiers without requiring a lot of labeled data and without having to train a large model end-to-end.
- as a warm start: the VGGish model parameters can be used to initialize part of a larger model which allows faster fine-tuning and model exploration.
    """,
    limitations="""
    VGGish has been trained on millions of YouTube videos and although these are very diverse, there can still be a domain 
    mismatch between the average YouTube video and the audio inputs expected for any given task. You should expect to do some 
    amount of fine-tuning and calibration to make VGGish usable in any system that you build.
