        ===============
        
        This package contains building blocks to make an encrypted connection via one or more intermediate hosts possible.
        The underlying foundation is SSH with the ProxyJump directive enabled.
        This package also contains modules that provides a variety of services.
        For simplicity, all modules are designed in a functional manner.
        
        The power of SSH is harnessed by the *transferagent.py* and *tunnel.py* modules.
        These modules are responsible for copying the Agent (*agent.py*) to the destination host and setting up tunneling.
        Once tunneling is established, the Agent is executed by *bootstrapagent.py* by utilizing the stdin of Tunnel.
        The Instructor (*instructor.py*) is responsible for starting and stopping services provided by the Agent.
        These services includes: redirection of internet traffic (TOR mode), copying files (FILE mode), and issuing commands (INTERACTIVE mode).
        For port forwarding (FOR mode), the program simply relies on SSH itself.
        The Instructor communicates with the Agent by sending JSON messages over the forwarded connection provided by Tunnel.
        The Agent also responds to heartbeats send by localhost to check if connection is still intact.
        
        Use the package **powermolecli** to interact with this library.
        
        
        
        How it works
        ============
        
        Terminology
        -----------
        * **Tunnel** is an established connection from localhost to the target destination host through intermediate hosts (called Gateways).
        * **Agent** is a python module running on the target destination host. It performs various functions.
        * **Instructor** sends instructions to the *Agent* by utilizing a forwarded connection provided by *Tunnel*.
        
        The program uses ssh to connect to the last host via one or more intermediaries.

        Through port forwarding, the program can communicate with the agent on the last host.
        
        .. image:: ../img/illustration_how_it_works_2.png
        
        
        The Instructor in conjuction with the Agent provides four modes:
        
         * TOR mode
         * FOR(warding) mode
         * INTERACTIVE mode
         * FILE mode
        
        See `cli <https://github.com/yutanicorp/powermolecli>`_ package for applications (uses).
        
        
        Development Workflow
        ====================
        
        The workflow supports the following steps
        
         * lint
         * test
         * build
         * document
         * upload
         * graph
        
        These actions are supported out of the box by the corresponding scripts under _CI/scripts directory with sane defaults based on best practices.
        Sourcing setup_aliases.ps1 for windows powershell or setup_aliases.sh in bash on Mac or Linux will provide with handy aliases for the shell of all those commands prepended with an underscore.
        
        The bootstrap script creates a .venv directory inside the project directory hosting the virtual environment. It uses pipenv for that.
        It is called by all other scripts before they do anything. So one could simple start by calling _lint and that would set up everything before it tried to actually lint the project
        
        Once the code is ready to be delivered the _tag script should be called accepting one of three arguments, patch, minor, major following the semantic versioning scheme.
        So for the initial delivery one would call
        
            $ _tag --minor
        
        which would bump the version of the project to 0.1.0 tag it in git and do a push and also ask for the change and automagically update HISTORY.rst with the version and the change provided.
        
        
        So the full workflow after git is initialized is:
        
         * repeat as necessary (of course it could be test - code - lint :) )
           * code
           * lint
           * test
         * commit and push
         * develop more through the code-lint-test cycle
         * tag (with the appropriate argument)
         * build
         * upload (if you want to host your package in pypi)
         * document (of course this could be run at any point)
        
        
        Important Information
        =====================
        
        This template is based on pipenv. In order to be compatible with requirements.txt so the actual created package can be used by any part of the existing python ecosystem some hacks were needed.
        So when building a package out of this **do not** simple call
        
            $ python setup.py sdist bdist_egg
        
        **as this will produce an unusable artifact with files missing.**
        Instead use the provided build and upload scripts that create all the necessary files in the artifact.

        ------------------
        
        * tunnel.py is heavily refactored: 1) instead of assigning individual ports to the instance a dictionary is used, 2) a new method is created named periodically_purge_buffer() which should be called once from the cli + agentassistant.py is renamed to instructor.py
        
        
        1.0.1 (16-05-2020)
        ------------------

        ------------------
        
        * Assistant() renamed to Instructor() and start() of transferagent modified (due to bugfix: the agent module could never be copied successfully)
        
        
        2.0.1 (04-07-2020)
        ------------------
        
        * scp versions released after 21 Apr 2020 breaks when using the ProxyJump directive. this error is shown during execution of powermole when user has a newer scp installed. at this moment no solution how to deal with this issue.
        
        
        2.1.0 (04-07-2020)
