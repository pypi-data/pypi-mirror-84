        OTools stands for Online Tools, which is a Python/Cython framework for developing multithread online systems in a simple way.
        
        This framework is the evolution of [Akuanduba](https://github.com/gabriel-milan/Akuanduba), a very similar framework I've developed.
        Although Akuanduba seemed OK to me, I realized it wasn't really user-friendly. OTools was developed to get as simple as possible
        and yet powerful.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Just install it by using pip!
        
        ```
        pip3 install otools
        ```
        
        ## Getting started
        
        I wouldn't recommend going straight to the [examples](https://github.com/gabriel-milan/otools/tree/master/examples) or trying to write code of your own,
        but it's up to you!
        
        My recommendation is:
        
        * Read the [OTools 101](https://otools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#otools-101) at the docs (or just read the [full documentation](https://otools.readthedocs.io/en/latest))
        * Start by running the [simplest example](https://github.com/gabriel-milan/otools/tree/master/examples/simple_example)
        * (Optional) Check out few [other examples](https://github.com/gabriel-milan/otools/tree/master/examples)
        * Write code of your own
        * Submit issues [here](https://github.com/gabriel-milan/otools/issues).
        
        ## Future releases
        
        * Implement CLI (?)
