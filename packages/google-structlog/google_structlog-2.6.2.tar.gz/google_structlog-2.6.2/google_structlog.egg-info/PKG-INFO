Description: Out of the box setup for python apps to send structured logs to 
        Google Cloud's Stackdriver, in a format that allows stackdriver queries
        over the structure.
        
        This package sets up structured logging with stackdriver that Just Works(TM):
        no configuration required. There's no confurability, 
        but virtually no API means its easy to leave behind if you outgrow it.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ```python
        from google_structlog import getLogger
        
        logger = getLogger()
        logger.warn('Danger Will Robinson', source='Robot', target='Will Robinson', threat='Boredom')
        ```
        
        The logger comes from [structlog](https://www.structlog.org/) and allows all the options you'd expect on a `structlog.get_logger()` logger, including binding of repeated attributes:
        ```python
        from google_structlog import getLogger
        logger = getLogger()
        # Include source= and target= values in the output of all calls to sublogger
        sublogger = logger.bind(source='Robot', target='Will Robinson')
        sublogger.warn('Danger Will Robinson: impending maintenance', threat='Responsibility')
        ```
