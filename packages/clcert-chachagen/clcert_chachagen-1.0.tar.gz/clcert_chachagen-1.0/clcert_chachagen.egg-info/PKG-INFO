Description: # ChaCha20-Generator-Utilities - Python
        Uses the ChaCha20 implementation in pycryptodome https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ as a base for various functions related to random number generation.
        
        The actual file is chacha20_generator.py inside the folder "clcert_chachagen", but we structured it this way to make use of setup.py and make the python version a proper package.
        
        ## Requirements
        ```
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        ## Examples
        ```python
        # Create a chacha object with a seed (hexadecimal)
        chacha = ChaChaRand("5ee5e2327a68a9db8a78efdaa855d102ed8bf14e128e0a72ae1c9d72e5f9747e27479f21dfbfd501")
        
        # Create a chacha object with a zeros seed
        chacha_zero = ChaChaRand()
        
        # Get a float in [0, 1)
        chacha.random()          # 0.47738372261817247
        # Get some random bytes
        chacha.getbytes(3)      # b'z5\xd1'
        # Get a number between [0, 100]
        chacha.randint(100)     # 53
        # Reseed (essentially the same as creating an entirely new one with the new seed)
        chacha.reseed("8ee5e2327a68a9db8a78efdaa855d102ed8bf14e128e0a72ae1c9d72e5f9747e27479f21dfbfd501")
        ```
