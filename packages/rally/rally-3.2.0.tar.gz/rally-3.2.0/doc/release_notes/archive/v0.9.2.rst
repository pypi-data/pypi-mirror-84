Details
-------

The latest OpenStack merged a bunch of incompatible changes. This release
is an attempt to fix compatibitily issuses in Rally 0.9.
Now it works well for old and new OpenStack releases.

.. note:: OpenStack Nova abandoned networking and image API. It is impossible
  to do anything with it, so we suggest you to use Neutron and Glance instead.

Fixed bugs
~~~~~~~~~~

* [broken dependency] One of hook plugins required ansible which released
  incompatible version. To fix this, the proper version of os-faults lib should
  be used

* [keystone] The format of keystone URL's completely change which resulted in a
  wrong processing it from our side.

Thanks
~~~~~~

 2 Everybody!
