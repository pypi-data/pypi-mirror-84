Verification Component
======================

Functional testing is a first step to ensuring that your product works as
expected and API covers all use-cases. Rally Verification Component is all
about this. It is not designed to generate a real big load (for this job we
have :ref:`task-component`), but it should be enough to check that your
environment works by different tools (we call them
:ref:`glossary-verification`).
