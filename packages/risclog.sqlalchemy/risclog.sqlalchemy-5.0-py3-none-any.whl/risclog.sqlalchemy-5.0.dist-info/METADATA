==================
risclog.sqlalchemy
==================

risclog.sqlalchemy encapsulates `sqlalchemy`_ modelling infrastructure. It
eases the setup of (multi-)database environments and the usage of sqlalchemy
models by providing often used functionality on special classes.

This package is compatible with Python version 3.6 up to 3.9.

Change log for risclog.sqlalchemy
=================================

5.0 (2020-11-03)
================

Backward incompatible changes
-----------------------------

- Drop support for Python 2.

- Drop the ``python2`` extra in ``setup.py``.

Features
--------

- No longer constraint to ``zope.component < 4.4.1`` (introduced in 3.0).


4.0 (2020-02-17)
================

Backward incompatible changes
-----------------------------

- Add support for ``zope.sqlalchemy >= 1.3`` by requiring at least this version.
  (Older versions only supported ``zope.sqlalchemy <= 1.2``.)

- Drop support for PyPy, PyPy3, Python 3.4 and 3.5.

Other changes
-------------

- Add support for Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9a3.

- Migrate to Github.


3.0 (2018-01-16)
================

- Drop support for Python 3.3.

- Reintroduce `RoutingSession.using_bind` as it is needed for executing queries
  in multi database environments. It was removed in version `2.0`.

- Pin to ``zope.component < 4.4.1`` for now as we are using a private variable
  from this package which has been removed lately.


2.3 (2017-04-06)
================

- Add the fixture ``.fixtures.database__selenium_testing`` to switch SQLAlchemy
  session handling to into the same way the live server does it. Using this
  fixture leads to `DetachedInstanceError` exceptions when using a database
  object after the commit. It has to be fetched again from the database.

- Omit files from sdist which are related to buildout, testing or mercurial.

2.2 (2017-01-12)
================

- Support Python 3.6 and PyPy3.

- Fix `setup.py` to no longer use absolute paths.


2.1 (2016-01-25)
================

- Add compatibility to `pypy`.

  Also removed explicit dependency to `psycopg2` as it's a PostgreSQL specific
  dependency and not compatible with pypy. You will need `psycopg2cffi` in
  order to run `risclog.sqlalchemy` with `pypy`.


2.0 (2015-12-18)
================

- Removed ``RoutingSession.using_bind``, require SQLAlchemy >= 1.0. (#13968)

- Updated API calls to alembic, require alembic >= 0.7. (#13968)

- Added documentation. (#13952)


1.8 (2015-09-29)
================

- Officially supporting Python 3.3 up to 3.5.

- Set maximum supported version numbers of ``alembic`` and ``SQLALchemy``
  in `setup.py`


1.7.1 (2014-10-15)
==================

- Fix bug in testing mode detection so it works with sqlite, too.


1.7 (2014-07-29)
================

- Have ``.model.Object.create`` use the ``**kw`` constructor instead of
  performing setattr itself.

- Made commit in db.empty optional.


1.6 (2014-06-23)
================

- Make test setup/teardown a bit more independent from the IDatabase utility.
- Made pyramid dependent code optional, because it is an optional requirement.


1.5.1 (2014-03-31)
==================

- Moved the project to bitbucket.org and prepared for public release.


1.5 (2014-03-06)
================

- Adjust test dependency for external projects, so pyramid is not required.
  (#1458)


1.4 (2014-01-27)
================

- Do not truncate `spatial_ref_sys` when emptying entire database. (#13144)


1.3 (2013-12-18)
================

- Do not truncate `alembic_versions` when emptying entire database (using
  `db.empty(engine)`)

- Fix create_defaults, so it can be used with multiple engines. (#1172)


1.2 (2013-12-13)
================

- Fixed setup.py


1.1 (2013-12-13)
================

- Allow ``.db.Database.empty()`` to not restart sequences. (This can be
  necassary if the user is not allowed to call `ALTER SEQUENCE`.)

- Create factory for JSON renderer, so it can be customized via arguments.
  (#1037)


1.0 (2013-12-11)
================

- CAUTION: Backward incompatible changes to provide multiple database
  support. You need to change:

  * Use the ``pyramid`` extra to use the pyramid serializers and call
    ``.serializer.patch()`` by yourself.

  * Changes in `.model`:

    + Use `.model.declarative_base(cls)` to register a class as SQLALchemy
      ``declarative_base``.

    + Use your own declarative_base as `.model.Object` has been dropped.

    + Create your own `ReflectedObject` as `.model.ReflectedObject` has been
      dropped.

  * Changes in `.db.Database`:

    + To get an instance use `.db.get_database(testing=<True|False>)`.

    + To register a database with the utility use ``register_engine``.

    + ``empty`` now expects to get the engine as first argument and allows to
      cadcade via (``cascade=True``).


    + ``_verify`` was removed, use ``_verify_engine`` now.

    + ``setup_utility`` was removed, it is now done in ``__init__``.

    + To access former ``engine``` attribute use ``get_engine``.

    + ``close`` was renamed to ``drop_engine``.

    + To create all tables for a database use ``create_all``.

  * Changes in `.testing`:

    + ``setUpDB`` lost its first argument as it was not used.

    + ``setUp`` now expects a dict or ``None``, see its docstring.

- Provide a way to insert default values for new created models. (#1137)

- Added support for schema migrations with alembic.

- Dropped support for `Python 2.6`.

- Added convenience functions to create `py.test` database fixtures.

- Declared `pyramid` as test dependency so tests only need the ``test``
  extra.

- Declared testing dependency on `plone.testing[test]` since we use
  `plone.testing.zca` which imports that ``test`` extra's dependencies.


0.6 (2013-06-27)
================

- Added convenience methods on `.db.Database` for teardown in tests.

- Updated to Buildout 2.

- Using py.test as testrunner.

- Added Python 3.3 compatibility.


0.5 (2013-06-14)
================

- Add Database methods for setting up a database utility and emptying tables.

- Add testing layer that sets up a database utility (requires plone.testing).


0.4 (2013-06-07)
================

- Add helper to provide transparent json encoding of sqlalchemy mapped objects,
  dates, datetimes and decimals. (#39)

- Add `create_defaults` class method on base model which can be used to create
  test data into the database.


0.3 (2013-06-04)
================

- Repair db setup for reflected and unreflected objects.


0.2 (2013-06-04)
================

- Add unreflected Object model next to the reflected Object model.


0.1 (2013-06-03)
================

initial release
